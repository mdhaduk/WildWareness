        <h5><strong>Description:</strong> </h5>
        <p>Trinity Center is a faith-based organization conducting programs that serve the spiritual, emotional and physical needs of the poor and homeless in Austin.</p>
        <p>We are committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. We strive to serve our unhoused community equally, regardless of gender, race, sexual identity, or orientation. With a focus on fairness and impartiality in the way we provide services, we embrace the power of lived experience and equity to inform our work.</p>
        <p>Being a small organization allows us to offer a personal, familiar touch as we work with our neighbors each day. We have a staff of only six dedicated people, and we rely on people like you who commit to a three-hour volunteer shift weekly. We greet each other as neighbors instead of as providers and clients. We treat our neighbors with dignity and respect. In fact, we feel very proud of the manner in which our staff and volunteers “lead by acceptance,” resulting in neighbors who feel acknowledged and understood, have a sense of ownership of Trinity Center, and consider it their community center. Neighbors rely on us when they have nowhere else to go. As one of our neighbors stated in an August 2009 survey, “Trinity Center has been an anchor in a time of storm."</p>
        <p>Trinity Center achieves its mission through:</p>
        <li>Volunteer opportunities that foster compassion, understanding and acceptance of God's people who are homeless and poor</li>
        <li>Neighborly hospitality in a caring environment</li>
        <li>Collaboration with similarly-focused agencies, faith-based organizations, service providers and partner congregations</li>
        <li>The responsible use of space provided by St. David's Episcopal Church</li>
