            "I would like to take the time to express my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude that I received from Hope The Mission. Approximately 30 days ago I was totally crestfallen, because I had a major financial setback that had me on the verge of becoming homeless. Nonetheless, I reached out to Hope The Mission on Tyrone/Victory Blvd. located in San Fernando Valley, and they provided the hope that I needed. With that being said, Mrs. Kay, Mrs. Kimberly and Mrs. Liz advocated to assist me with my rental expenses. I've always said, it takes a Village to assist with a crisis, and they were that Village that came to my rescue. Notwithstanding, thank you Mrs. Kay for being a conduit that lead to Mrs. Kimberly P. and Mrs. Liz V., because without their tenacious spirit and incessant drive, I would not have been approved for assistance. You all were a raw, uncut and polished Gem that exuded and illustrated a ray of hope and light that will forever shine. Again, thanks a million times over for all of you guy's support. Respectfully, P.T.",
            "Great service for goups. And hot foods are very homey but the outside services are bad. who arrests inconocent homeless people? Overall some of the management in the housing programs are rude and need to be more settling."

They help people on such a deeper level that I am not sure that they even know or notice. Well, I noticed, and I am so eternally grateful. Staff here are amazing, inspiring, patient, endearing, fun, funny, direct, and well defined. I've never fought so hard for my sobriety as I continue to do every day. Awesome case managers, and the security is squared away. They are a collective of realism led by an honor roll staff of great people. The church and counseling offered are so beyond exceptional. They want and allow people to find their purpose and reason to stay sober and excel. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Helping those who are willing to make a change and still willing to help those who aren‚Äôt quite ready by pushing them into the right direction. I can‚Äôt forget to mention the love they have for each and every child that comes in with no hesitation. They make the children feel loved. My son absolutely loves all the staff here.

All I have to do is just let them visit me for 5 minutes every month and that's only to check up on me to see if I need anything like a haircut voucher or a box of food.\nThe only thing is that the curfew is at 7:30pm and you have to leave after breakfast (which is 7:30pm, if I remember right), unless you work or go to school. If you're on drugs then you probably won't make it, even with those simple rules (from what I saw).

            "I recently visited interfaith in Sonora,ca. A lady named Deborah informed me they could help me get a battery for my RV I just needed to bring a quote for the battery so I went to Napa Auto parts. Then returned to Deborah office whom upon my first visit stated that she to was once homeless so I thought she cared about me and my struggles since my of wife's  recent passing. 33years married to the love of my life. But thanks to living in toulomene county where most of the citizens are a product of in breading it really should come as no surprise to me that she is a liar and has no interest in truly helping anyone. So beware if you ever need help I would not recommend going to them for assistance. Thanks to Sargent passuqie (misspelled) touolueme county sheriff giving me a ticket for out of date registration. fine $160.00 which I just bought in January of 2024  and registration cost $785.00 the registration should not have been due until January of 2025. But thanks to the seller having lied about his wife having paid to keep vehicle on non-op. Again a citizen of toulomene countys (embreaded population) I am done with living in a society that has no compassion for anyone but them selfs,where lying is okay and the welfare system is a joke and if your a Senior Citizen in this county (good luck) because no one cares about you not even the ones displaying the cross that my Savior Jesus Christ died on as part of their business advertisement is all fake misleading which offers nothing more than creating a false sense of caring to for it's citizens. As for the Sargent for toulomene county again (my guess is a product of embreading) hello new State Law effective 2024 States it is illegal for officers to ticket a person for simply having expired tags for 60 days but on the start of the 90 day they can legally issue you a ticket the exception is if a driver has committed some other type of motor vehicle infraction can they issue a ticket.. know the law if your in a position of enforcing the laws.  Oh it's no superise that Debroah and The fine Sargent choose to profile the less fortunate by demonstrating what can happen when you are a product of embreading in toulomene county.  That's it I'm done you win have lived a fair life but I can't take it anymore so I'm going to say goodbye and pray for God's forgiveness for my selfish actions. Both Deborah √†nd the good Sargent should not be in a position where they can cause people to loose hope and cause people to take their lives. Especially in positions where they have a duty to protect and serve the citizens (weather imbread or not) all people deserve better treatment no matter to their situation may be good luck and good bye oh I know who cares anyway right.",

            "Nice to see the remodel currentl(2024) for the women & children's side to a bunkbed dorm style downstairs(Finally) they can fit almost 3x the amount of women they can compared to when I stayed there couple months(09/2021-12/2021) until I got exited. Don't ask why, Idk why. Not the point. Point is the women's mission part is doing an upgrade should've been done years ago. Let's just say many many MANY things people that aren't from Humboldt get shocked when they find out things more than not counties in Cali, Majority of Humboldt County 'Help' (ambulances, sober living transitional housing, etc) is privately funded. Then again it is faith based so it's makes since a church probably has it under its wing. Since I'm not a religious person when I stayed there the directors would give use the choice to step out during services. If we would like to sit outside, so that was legit due to alot of places that are faith based they force their 'clients' to attend them, mandatory. Otherwise, you were living there much longer. It was sad due to the fact that some religions find sacrilegious to attend or even think about a diff. Religion. So honestly that's the only reason I could stay there because if it was forced upon me, that's just not cool. I'm just grateful they let me stay a few months when I needed."

But when there its all about structure. So if your acting out of line and they call the cops on you it doesn't make anyone snitchs. Its called policy. I'm giving Hospitality House 4/5 Stars. My main reason of 4 instead of 5 is that they need to start testing everyone that comes in there and start monitoring those who sneak out past 9pm curfew. The favoritism needs to stop too. It's good to have favorites however business is business. Tracy knew that as a supervisor. Just cause he was friends with certain people. Doesn't mean you get to go out late at night and have fun, or smoke in the bathrooms, etc. Other than that the supervisors aren't the problem its the residents.

I talked to three different female workers who all stated that even though the check in time was 3-5pm that they never turn anyone away and that women that need shelter can come at anytime. I show up to drop off my friend and the women who working the early day shift were super rude and kicked us off the property. I tried to explain that we called the day before and the information we were told but the women working at that time kept cutting me off, saying, I don't care what anyone said to you, get off the property. I tried to explain that my friend isn't safe on the street because she is disabled and unable to defend herself or run away from any possible predators. The lady working told me that she didn't care, that check in time is only 3-5pm and to get off the property or she would call the cops.\n\nWe were not being loud. We drove into the property in a quiet little car, no music playing or anything. We called when we got there. Got shut down and hung up on the phone first and then were sitting in the parking lot trying to figure out where to go when the women worker came out and started demanding that we left the property. That's when I tried to explain the situation and the people we previously spoke with.",

For a place that is supposedly trying to 'help' people, they are ridiculously intrusive on your privacy, as well as demeaning and disrespectful to you as a person. The vibe & atmosphere there feels very much like minimum security jail. Not the feeling one should have to experience when one is trying to move on and better their lives. A person named Tamara was the head when I was there; a very unfriendly and rude individual. I got the feeling that she does not like people of color, particularly black people. I understand we all have hard times & situations that may fall upon us, but I would definitely avoid this place like the plague if at all possible."

Salvation Army is a bad neighbor and they have turned a once charming area into a blighted homeless magnet. This spills onto Texas Street and to business offices nearby.  They refuse to even speak with residents about the rampant crime on their property and its effect on downtown residents, not to mention the strain on local law enforcement who have to respond to many calls there. This location is inappropriate for this service when we are working so hard to revitalize our struggling downtown business reputation. Residents find boxes and bags full of discarded food all over downtown. Just because this service is needed does not mean Salvation Army should not be clean, safe, and responsible providing such services. Shame on them!",

There are no other means to pay.for assistance.\n\nCAP has come to our rescue, we have been with them a few years and had help with roof that had been leaking.  We had gone two winters without a heater until CAP replaced.  We got a new refrigerator, new shower heads, fire alarm, lighting, a new back door and new kitchen and bathroom floor repair due to water damage.  Just last week, our main bathroom floor was more severely damaged than when we first got the report.  Our bathroom floor looks brand new, what a fantastic job the CAP team did!\n\nWe just wouldn‚Äôt have been able to afford all those repairs and appliance purchases.\n\nWe were blessed beyond anything imagined and wish we could compensate the organization.  They work with funding issues and they worked hard for our case.  Saying thank you just doesn‚Äôt seem enough of what we have in our ‚ô•Ô∏è hearts.  Dell had stood out, we got to see him the most. He was a joy to have him return.   We were educated and never made to feel  guilt or shame for needing their services.  And knowing that others may have not gotten their needs met due to funding and all the work they helped us with.  The team every time were so kind and professional.\n\nGod love you all and if I was a fairy with a magic wand, all your needs would be met and to each of you who participated in our projects, you‚Äôd be heading to Vegas and the first machine you select would be sprinkled with fairy dust!

I ended up doing everything on my own. I had to leave for my own mental well-being. I was neglected as well as talked over and ignored. They can't help people recover their identification, they can't help people flee from abusive situations, and they cannot provide access for people who need urgent medical care. If you due to unfortunate circumstances loose identification because of homelessness, arson, abandonment, ect., you will not be able to recover this critical information through safe alliance.  If you need expensive medical treatment do not trust safe alliance to deliver on this either. They have failed to help me in the most basic ways and have cost me so much time in trying to get back up on my feet. I've been done with safe alliance for a long time and do not wish to continue at all. By the way- the food distribution center actually distributes mostly GMO foods with the exception of only one or two Non GMO food items per delivery (I said this because they even lied to me about this).",

            "This place/ the staff and collaborators, are ALL AMAZING. They do so much more than just supportive housing for broken family's. They celebrate how a good life should feel EVERYDAY, for these people who TRULY need it the most. The effort and friendship that the employees express here is above and beyond.",

            "This place is trash. And when I say place, I mean more than half of the staff. No customer service training. Case managers are a joke. They do absolutely nothing to provide the help people need. They just perpetuate the problems of this town. The workers were clients themselves, but where is the actual social work experience? They don't dispense soap for the bathroom, and people don't wash their hands, nor kids. Plus roaches, plus mold, and some staff member is allergic to bleach, so we're not allowed to use it at certain times. No wonder so many people were sick for weeks on end. They stopped accepting donations. You're treated like an idiot or a child at times. They let people scream and curse at their children. The rules are enforced depending on who is working. My case manager Jessica lied to me about giving me an extension of two weeks. She told staff that I was still leaving as scheduled and it caught me off guard. This place and its employees need an undercover to investigation. Please, please. See how this place is ran. You would be appalled. How does one report this place?",
            "Shut the phone homeless St Mary's dining hall and the shelter I can honestly say over 30 years ago I was homeless as a teenager and I respect the business and what they do and they support everyone now my visit was not to the shelter it was for the outside people living on the streets I gave them candles I gave them stew again some charcoal and some matches so they can keep their places warm candles when it's dark so the homeless shelter itself I give them much love so they get five stars but what I do has nothing to do with the shelter for the people that's outside that don't have inside shelter thank you"

Michelle is the house manager and is extremely unprofessional and two faced she will smile in your face and write u up and get u kicked out so fast. They Don't care about women and children. They will write u up so u loose points and kick u out. My entire time here I was bullied by the staff. If u see a negative review believe it dont just think its a bitter ex resident. I thought that and had to learn the hard way the review was true. The pastor is also petty and not god focused gracious or kind. This shelter should be shut down for how they treat residents and exploit them for free labor. No one likes living there but they put up with it due to limited options.",

            "While I was here I seen a lot of people get kicked out.  They would lose their points fast if they have kids.  Most of the staff I loved.  Some of the staff picked on people just to make them loose their points so they would be kicked out.  I also was told I couldn't receive any help with finding a place for my daughter and I because I didn't make enough money at the time I was in disability.  I was told that I had to get a job or more income.  I feel that they could work on actually helping people who need and deserve the help.  I wasn't released to go back to work by several doctors and to be told that I wouldn't be helped because I was to low income really made me lose hope.  What was worse is I watched a family member of staff who was on drugs and bragged about using drugs qualify for help thru the programs available. This person also bragged about being a family member and that's why she got her rent paid for and utilities for several months.  I feel that haven of peace would do much better actually trying to help people get back on their feet.  I do however realize what the staff had to deal with on a daily basis.  Very ungrateful,  selfish,  uneducated,  lazy,  individuals.  People who just use the system and refuse to even try to do their chores or respect the rules.  I'm very grateful for even being able to stay for the month we got to stay for.  Furthermore,  my daughter and I will not forget several of the staff their that were exceptional people!! That's why I gave a 4 star rating.  I hope you improve on the few things I've mentioned.  Thank you.",
            "If you are ever without a home please never come to this place it will leave you with even more problems than just a home! My mother came here with my sister and my niece and they had to go to the hospital for dehydration and kidney infection. The reason why they got dehydrated was because they only handed out 1 water bottle a day (the average human needs 8 per day) and the owners never let outside food or drinks (I understand because they don't want more problems other than they're rat infestation but my mother wanted to bring water in and they didn't allow her to) and when the owners were going to throw away water that someone had donated my mother and her friend were trying to keep it but the owners forced her to put it back. The kidney infections they got were from the filth of this place. The kids were so poorly managed they they would rub their fecal matter along the wall and that gave the kidney infections to my mother my sister and to their friend. The owners were too busy \"praying to their god\" that they did not address to abuse the children were going through. My mother tried to tell the owners that the children were getting struck daily for no reason just to get their mothers anger out but the owner turned her back and said she needs to go pray to god first. Since the mothers (there were 4 of them) heard my mother telling the owner about their abuse to their own children, they threatened my 55 year old mothers, my 13 year old sisters and my 5 year old nieces lives and my sister even suffered a panic attack twice and had to go to the hospital due to her not being able to breath. They were scared to go back but they had to. When they did one of the kids who was 7 walked up to my mother with a heart on a piece of paper and apologized for her mothers actions and she said she understands the pain my family went through and said that her mother hurts her too but she needs to care for her 1 year old sibling since her mother won't and it honestly broke all of our hearts to see that she was so young and understood that she was going through verbal and physical abuse daily and when her mother  seen she had any drawing or school work her mother forced her to throw it away and said that she doesn't like \"bullshit\" like that around her and the owner turned her back to this kind of abuse and when the little girl couldn't keep her 1 year old sibling quiet she got hit and even when another kid who was 3 weeks old couldn't stop crying its mother would punch the child to shut up and no justice was brought to these children they are still going through this abuse daily and no one is doing any thing about it. The 4 mothers would constantly attack my family by using verbal abuse to her and to my sister and niece. When my mother tried to leave with my sister and niece they threw her stuff into bags and left it outside but kept all of their clothes. 3 out of the 4 mothers got kicked out but the owners never told the police about the abuse of the children so they still have their kids somewhere and they're probably get hit right now as I'm writing this and it disgusts me that these people get to walk away with their kids even when their kids are getting constantly abused. I hope no one comes here anymore and please if you need a home find somewhere different than here this is the worst place you could ever go to!"

            "This place is so wrong. And they lied to us. They took somebody a young man that worked hard to detox and then come to their center to get help. They accused him of all kinds of stuff the first night and they said he had to sleep in the basement with the homeless And drug addicts down below. They never really talk to him to find out what really happened. They just accused him. They told me they were a Christian based place. This does not sound Christian to me. I went and got him the night they told To sleep in the basement. They degraded him. They treated him like an animal, and he did nothing. I.Brought him home and now they‚Äôre saying they saw him on the street sleeping on the ground getting up and acting funny the next morning and they‚Äôre going by hearsay. Let me tell you this. This is the worst place you could send your child. He‚Äôs been cut down so bad that I am concerned and worried about him and I blame it all on this place. Thank you so much for lying to me and my family and giving us hope for him. he‚Äôs trying so hard to do everything right he was so happy to be there and you say it‚Äôs mandatory that he sleeps in the basement for two weeks. There‚Äôs something definitely wrong with this program that you would send someone down there with homeless people drug addicts and it‚Äôs freezing cold. I‚Äôm sending all this information to my attorney that my husband and I have had for years and we will just see how far you get with what you Have done to my son. I‚Äôm pretty reasonable person, but I‚Äôm not now not with you lying like you did if I could, I would name every single one of you that did this to him but I Can‚Äôt if I‚Äôm going to start a lawsuit against you.",

            "I live to declare the goodness of the Lord JESUS and show His glory and power. I thank Him for Roseville Gathering Inn. The directors changed while I was there, and I will say this about the current director... She is truly a representation of Jesus. She is directed by him, and not of man. She serves both the believing and non believing with the same love you read about Him having in the Bible. I was a recipient of said love. I thank God for Lindsey. Cheyenne was my case worker, very trying job she had to fit an hour in. I'm long winded, and was suffering the loss of my sister. Only people who know me know what that truly meant to my life. I probably died with her though I'm still breathing. None the less God is good. I thank Him for her life. Cheyenne offered me direction, encouragement, and with that, hope. I thank God for her. Truly was 3 months behind in my car note, lost my place, and breaking down because my sister passed when she got me. I prayed to God before I got here. I said you have to hold me Jesus because I'm not going to make it without you. Then I ended up here. I still have my car and more. Love that lady. Farah, Carmen üíõ, Chuck, Rob love love love these people. True servants. Ms. Kim ‚ù§Ô∏è, boy oh boy what can I say... Don't ever bring your child here to be scared straight like I did. He got so much love from the donation closet and the actual people in the shelter he didn't want to leave. Children at this shelter don't suffer in homelessness, and one would assume that is so. They are diligent, watchful, and protectors here staff and residents alike. The Gathering Inn fosters a strong community, and they accept EVERYBODY. Even people like me who was accepted nowhere, and they showed me LOVE and that pores over to my baby. That was HEALING. Thank you Jesus! Ms. Kim gave him some ridiculous toys PLURAL that couldn't fit in the back seat barely, and it was to my benefit because my mom and grandma were always distrusting of me. My mom entertained the thought of my son being with me overnight when I was here. After I left my mom opened up more and more because TGI helped so much my mama could see the difference. I am back with my family, and FULLY active in my son's life. Nikki was the first director when I came. This woman could do something only my sister could, understand me and talk to me in a way that cured my anxiety and brought me understanding in a SENTENCE. Usually people would have to wrestle with me or refuse me. She never had to. She had a way of knowing what was wrong that I couldn't articulate in my suffering and speak to that. Love her and I love this place. When a certain worker became hostile towards me along with certain residents, and actually harassed me with them, which NOBODY outside this one person ever did Lindsey didn't just take their side she listened to me covered protected and moved me. Some residents also covered and protected me too. These people that work here and this institution itself was the hands and feet of Christ in my life. A true answer to prayer. God is good. Thank you Jesus for TGI. You are good.",

            "Stppoed by to say hello..utilized their services a couple years ago. Unfortunately as I'm allergic to mold staying in mainly old churches wrecked havoc on my sinuses. Beyond that 10 out 10 would recommend as they really try to assist the homeless.  And they have a clothing closet so if you are interested in donating it goes directly to those in need free of charge.",

            "I experienced the most devastating events of my life at this place since the death of my sister at the beginning of last year, and I just wanted to come on here to proclaim the goodness of God. Nothing is perfect because we are on this Earth and dealing with imperfect people. I can see with all the imperfection diligent people who are the hands and feet of Jesus whether they recognize him by that name or not. I can see the fruits of the spirit in 90% of the people here whether believer or non believer. Even though because of the negligent, abusive, and predatory actions of one individual my husband could die, God doesn't cease to be good. Jesus is still Lord and Master, worthy of every praise. No matter the damage. I must still bless those who have cursed me, so I bless the woman employed here who cursed my family. Knowing a curse without a cause will not stand because that's what the word of God says. You can't curse what God has blessed. I also thank the people for the vision to erect places like this with the intentions of blessing their community. To Jesus be all the glory honor and praise. Please, pray for my husband's healing. He always seems to slip through the cracks, but no matter what happens, I will proclaim God's goodness all the louder. He can prevent the loss of life, but even if He doesn't He STILL is, WORTHY, and GOOD. I thank the staff that face the struggle of working with this population, feeling the heartbreak, and forging forward for good. Lindsey, Cheyenne, Farah, Carmen, Chuck, Coach, Rob....servants and an inspiration. They love and work hard for their community and they care care. Gabe, Nikki, Rose, Sarah, Hunter, Jenny, Meagan, Misty, Chris, Derrick üíõ, and Ms. Barbara. You all make the lives of so many people better, and I thank God for the experience I had that devastated me because through that I learned how valuable and important people like you all are to this community. Thank you for what you do and may God bless you in your endeavors and strengthen you to do His will. Oh! And Clyde üòä. Love you all. I am so terribly heartbroken, but there will be joy in the morning. Thank you Jesus, for TGI!",

            "I recently visited interfaith in Sonora,ca. A lady named Deborah informed me they could help me get a battery for my RV I just needed to bring a quote for the battery so I went to Napa Auto parts. Then returned to Deborah office whom upon my first visit stated that she to was once homeless so I thought she cared about me and my struggles since my of wife's  recent passing. 33years married to the love of my life. But thanks to living in toulomene county where most of the citizens are a product of in breading it really should come as no surprise to me that she is a liar and has no interest in truly helping anyone. So beware if you ever need help I would not recommend going to them for assistance. Thanks to Sargent passuqie (misspelled) touolueme county sheriff giving me a ticket for out of date registration. fine $160.00 which I just bought in January of 2024  and registration cost $785.00 the registration should not have been due until January of 2025. But thanks to the seller having lied about his wife having paid to keep vehicle on non-op. Again a citizen of toulomene countys (embreaded population) I am done with living in a society that has no compassion for anyone but them selfs,where lying is okay and the welfare system is a joke and if your a Senior Citizen in this county (good luck) because no one cares about you not even the ones displaying the cross that my Savior Jesus Christ died on as part of their business advertisement is all fake misleading which offers nothing more than creating a false sense of caring to for it's citizens. As for the Sargent for toulomene county again (my guess is a product of embreading) hello new State Law effective 2024 States it is illegal for officers to ticket a person for simply having expired tags for 60 days but on the start of the 90 day they can legally issue you a ticket the exception is if a driver has committed some other type of motor vehicle infraction can they issue a ticket.. know the law if your in a position of enforcing the laws.  Oh it's no superise that Debroah and The fine Sargent choose to profile the less fortunate by demonstrating what can happen when you are a product of embreading in toulomene county.  That's it I'm done you win have lived a fair life but I can't take it anymore so I'm going to say goodbye and pray for God's forgiveness for my selfish actions. Both Deborah √†nd the good Sargent should not be in a position where they can cause people to loose hope and cause people to take their lives. Especially in positions where they have a duty to protect and serve the citizens (weather imbread or not) all people deserve better treatment no matter to their situation may be good luck and good bye oh I know who cares anyway right.",

We have a, \"I didn't choose this life.\" crisis.\n\nAs a mother of an autistic child who watches TV, I thought to myself, how would I explain this to my child if he was watching right now? When there are so many disabilities that can afflict a child and family, why did they single out autism specifically as a contributor to this mother's crisis? Surely I know that having any special needs child is a challenge, but shouldn't we just call them \"special needs\" in an ad campaign. Why single out a certain group in a negative way like this. I strongly oppose cancel culture and having to be politically correct all of the time. But to single out a vulnerable population by name like this is really insensitive."

            "Upon hearing about the shelter I was pretty optimistic about the things i heard from a county sheriff. Once I got in there and an spoken to an employee at the front desk work. In the moment i was optimistic for the future for good reasons as she was a very kind, respectful, and genuinely empathetic of my situation..\nThis optimism quickly went away after having the first meeting with my caseworker whose job was supposedly to help me out with finding and securing permanent housing. Not only does she label my case as a self resolved best case meaning that when it comes to trying to find permanent housing in the city it would still be completely on me she will have no real help to offer. That in itself knowing that that was one of the key parts and one of the greatest things about the program Was very does a disappointing news for me at a very hard time but on top of having to receive the disappointing news she also talk to me like I was completely incompetent and in grade school the entire time !!! making me feel very belittled and overall worse about myself for putting myself in the situation. Understandable to believe that someone who is my age at the age of 23 must‚Äôve done a bunch of bad stuff To get him in the position financially that im in but from what my grandmother had told me originally just because someone has bad character (although i dont) doesn‚Äôt justify bad action. In the remainder of the week I was there. The span of my stay being only about a week and a half maybe two weeks I‚Äôve been assaulted by my roommate and when I say sold it I mean I look up to a about 6‚Äô2 close to 300 pound 19-year-old hitting me in my face . after already voicing my concerns about my roommate to one of the workers that were there during the night shift. to add to it upon my departure from the shelter after my bed Being closeds by my case worker\nFor coming in past curfew although I had every form of excuse They had originally said would be Accepted On top of a job I was working full-time The promises of storage that was given to me which I have in text stated that I would have 30 days to ultimately grab all of my things or it would be disposed of or donated. Three days into my supposed storage I went back to the shelter to collect my things with a mentor of sorts only to be told that somehow my things had been stolen. Even considering the situation I was in and the loss of what I‚Äôd like to say most of my life savings there were still no empathy from any of the workers or any real investigation done to figure out what happened to any of my things as far as I see it when it comes to anybody who fits my description you‚Äôre probably better off getting a storage on your own and just sleeping on the streets because not only will you be undermined and taunted for your current position you will also put yourself arabesque of being victimized by the people that claim they want to help you!!",

After being involved in an accident and unable to work or provide for myself temporarily, this facility opened it's doors to me, to help me.\n\nThere is a doctor, psyche, case manager, and other resources on-site weekly. Generally, meals are provided otherwise it is relatively independent living. Males and Females are housed in separate, clean, accommodating, dorm-type living arrangements. Appliances on sight to help with clean apparel, which if you are lacking, can also be provided from local donations.\n\nA swift, safe, comfortable, and pleasant recovery from my accident was a blessing that I believe many people could also benefit from. The staff is wonderful and goes above and beyond every day to ensure the clients are happy.\n\nShasta Community Health Center/H.O.P.E provides the medical portion for patients while Pathways To Housing leads with the housing/facilities.

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",

You get two cold and one hot meals and that's only if there is enough for everyone. The ambulance is here three plus times a day because of people over dosing on fentanyl. The city of chico is doing what it can to keep homeless people homeless,  after all, if we get homes how would you tell us apart from everyone else?",
            "[posted erroneously to \"camping cabin\" last month, reposting to Pallet Shelter]\n\nThe gift of shelter is a blessing üôè.  Without money, people spend 75% of their time  to get essentials, and the shelter provides food, water,  toilets, bathing, and laundry.  For the basics of survival, with  onsite access to health and other funded programs, gratitude is quite appropriate and very much appreciated.\n\nMy first night at the start of winter 2022 was particularly memorable: closing a lockable a door, having a warm meal, some new bedding, and turning on the heater with its own dial all meant a lot after 4 years of tent life. \"If I ever start to complain, please remind me of this moment\" held in stark contrast to prior living conditions.  That night slept on the floor as I was used to the hard earth, but I adjusted and had more time to focus on the available steps within reach to move forward.\n\nTo be able to transition to the next step in becoming a productive member of society again, and keep living with a lot less suffering, there are  onsite services for health, housing and employment programs that work to assist those with low or no income and varied backgrounds. All together in one place, these services and amenities provide more time to find what can actually help.\n\nTo those looking for help, keep trying. Talk to others and the volunteers, many elderly, some over 80 years old, who spend time just bringing goods to the homeless. Use the rebuttal / grievance form to ask about assessment and appeal.  The tiny home/pallet shelter concept is implemented around the country, and as a whole could be a good place to share a voice for understanding of the people in the homelessness \"crisis\" and the training of the intrepid few who work for the benefit of those without a residence and under dire circumstances just trying to live.\n\nRated 4/5 stars as IMHO there needs to be ‚Ä¢ more first aid,\n‚Ä¢ better and more food, and\n‚Ä¢ disaster training and drills for a living space of 177 units (200+ people and 90+ dogs) in a razor-wire, fenced-in community.\n\nSincerely,\nJay Tobias",

She has fibromyalgia and I'm Epileptic, with a tendency, especially in the heat of summer, to have seizures fairly often.\n\nWe had hoped that coming here would be the saving grace we needed...except that, at least for me, that hasn't been the case. Yes I'm in a pallet with my fiancee. It's more like an 8'x8'x10' shed. Portapotties are graffitied with profanity and sexualized commentary, even the odd gang symbol...music blares at all hours of the day, dogs snap at you as you walk by, food portions are abysmal.\n\nBut the absolute WORST is the lack of caring by the staff that run this place. I am BEYOND deeply disappointed. My stress has gone through the roof, increasing my seizure frequency, as well as being unable to sleep due to barking dogs, blaring music from both residents AND staff at all hours of the night, and people arguing both inside and outside of their pallets. I've seen needles and nitrous canisters lying around and in the toilets as well as gang symbols and not a SINGLE thing is ever done. We have mentioned the loud music affecting our physical health to the staff probably about 50 times, mostly by one individual and they are still here doing it. The common answer we received is \"it's not 10pm yet!\", which is when quiet hours begin. Do I even need to get into the residents who leave the pets droppings all over the place...?\n\nThis place needs to start following and enforcing the rules that THEY THEMSELVES put in place! It's not really that difficult! It is an absolute trash town within a beautiful city and they are ruining my mental health. If anyone is reading this... PLEASE HELP US!",

            "This place will definitely make your stay a nightmare if things don't go their way. Check your food there's mold. The staff will definitely hold grudges. The fact that it is better than being outside they will definitely make sure you stay in a homeless state of mind. They dare you to feel free and safe or speak your mind. Perfect place for imates. If you have an inmates mentality this is the perfect place for you. I was kicked out because the staff refused to retrieve my food box and when I confronted her for her foulness I was kicked out into the rain and they kept all my food and refuse to place me in the que for housing after I spent a year there cleaning disgusting gnats that flew in my hair and mouth as I slept. The coordinators refuse to listen to us as a human because we‚Äôre homeless (I‚Äôm guessing) but I watched a woman strike another woman in the face for no reason but I get kicked out for knowing my rights.",
            "These people do not help the families who stay there & the staff likes to terrorize residents by turning on the heaters during 80¬∞+ weather even though they refuse to turn it on in the winter. We stayed there for 4 months & they did not help us find any housing, then they stole our stuff on the way out. They have our $100 Vornado fan, a bunch of our kids clothes & containers, & my husband's family blanket. 1 staff member, Deb, uses drugs & hits on the male residents. She would not leave my husband alone, constantly coming to our door to bother us & ask him to do things & asking him to hug her.",
            "Vicious People. No support services whatsoever. Staff is just completely corrupt because there is no oversight for a homeless shelter. You'd think it was a punishment to be there, not a rescue type situation. The residents and staff collude to terrorize you. It's like jail is depicted in T.V. Only the toughest survive there.",

Everything is spontenous done and single status is wasting their time their are any Shelter Agencies, attituded and it shows through their prioritizing. Should be division of status to prevent hate practices in services provided also with their paricipating Welfare Agency. TERM using a minority."

            "I was here with my special needs son in 2020. We were not given any help and no matter how many list we got on for transitional housing we were always called back saying that we were denied due to my son's disability they told us that because of his condition and he hit other kids they could not give us housing. People who had children with autism or targeted, a lady was made to go outside and sleep in her car because her child was special needs was nocturnal which is common with a lot of children with special needs she was also threatened with CPS even though she had done absolutely nothing to her child. I was also threatened with CPS and that was another reason why I did not feel safe there apart from the neighborhood also being unsafe and all the shootings that were going on while I was there I felt very insane. Staff screened at us verbally abused me and my son. I also witnessed a lady that had twins and when she got to the shelter she had nothing this was during the pandemic so even though there was a places for people would come through domestic violence they couldn't get into those places because of the pandemic and the restrictions that it caused. This lady asked the staff if they could help her get diapers to which they responded that she would have to buy some. They also made us sign up for things like tablets but they were never given to us they were never delivered to us they were never basically given to us by the staff. I also witnessed staff receiving donations of clothing but not actually giving that clothing to the people that were at the homeless shelter I witness them loading it into the back of their cars and taking it with them. And I also witnessed the same exact thing with the towels and the blankets that were given for the homeless people they would take them home with them in the back of their cars put it in their trunk. We were highly discriminated against simply because we were light skinned, even though I am Hispanic I was discriminated against by these people who were African American. I had never experienced something like this and it was absolutely the most horrible experience I've ever had I left the homeless shelter and found a room to live in which I was very grateful for because that's why I had come to the homeless shelter to try to find housing and they were of no help whatsoever in fact they would tell the transitional housing places that my son was too difficult in that they should not take me and my son. I experienced a lot of racism simply because I was Hispanic and I was experiencing that from Caucasian social workers as well as African-American social workers. The experience was absolutely horrible eye opening and I don't wish it on anybody.",

After I left the tenant was written up and reprimanded for my 7 minute visit. Next Move should be there to assist their tenants and not harass them. They all come from different situations and circumstances, some out of their control. Perhaps the Directors, Board of Chairman‚Äôs and whoever else is in charge should come and talk to their tenants one on one to see what is really happening at Next Move.

Just a bunch of bums taking care of bums. So they aren't educated or aspire to be better. They are content with being who they are and in a world of content people. They are just another stone in the pond. Tonight I didn't have any protein for dinner. As they made the meal without any. They seemed to have made themselves lasagnas (the staff) and the cheese that they used could've been used for our meal. Yet they couldn't care less. If I had known that there would be no protein I would've got myself some from the store. I had no idea they were going to serve a meal that lacked nutrition at the most basic level so I'm actually surprised.",

After being involved in an accident and unable to work or provide for myself temporarily, this facility opened it's doors to me, to help me.\n\nThere is a doctor, psyche, case manager, and other resources on-site weekly. Generally, meals are provided otherwise it is relatively independent living. Males and Females are housed in separate, clean, accommodating, dorm-type living arrangements. Appliances on sight to help with clean apparel, which if you are lacking, can also be provided from local donations.\n\nA swift, safe, comfortable, and pleasant recovery from my accident was a blessing that I believe many people could also benefit from. The staff is wonderful and goes above and beyond every day to ensure the clients are happy.\n\nShasta Community Health Center/H.O.P.E provides the medical portion for patients while Pathways To Housing leads with the housing/facilities.

            "I stayed at One SAFE Place and am greatful that I did. They were able to give me enough time to get on my feet with my children, find a job and housing. There were a couple of bad apples there with the other clients and gossip and all that garbage but that's to be expected in a house full of women. The staff at times was not entirely professional and a little gossipy too but that's life. If you are determined to get your life together after a bad relationship, this is the place. Focus on your goals and dreams and don't let the petty stuff ruin your journey.\nMy children and I are doing well in part to the help we got here.\n\nThanks üòä",
            "I am going to try to be really objective here.  This agency is really helpful if you are in a situation where you need to leave quickly AND you have family, friends or resources available to you after your stay. Here is where I have a problem.  The max stay at OSP is 45 days.  If you have nowhere to go after that or have no one to help you, you are going to end up back with your abuser who is now even angrier and more violent.  They don't disclose this when you call in.  It's just \"come in and we will help you\".  They really can't help you with housing because in Shasta county the wait for subsidized housing is a minimum of about 6 months for project based subsidized housing and much longer for a section 8 voucher. In my case, I met with Cyndi, who was amazing.  She had me use the OSP address when I applied for section 8 because I did not want the person I was leaving to find out what I was planning.  Somehow, Cyndi ended up not working there and when the housing agency sent my paperwork to them, they dropped the ball and I got purged from the list. When I returned to see what they could do.  I got no explanation or apology.  I met with a 20 something advocate who seemed pretty clueless and didn't seem too keen on contacting the housing authority to help sort this mess out. She kept hammering on a restraining order.  While a restraining order is helpful in some situations, it can be dangerous or damaging in others.  I.E. with a narcissist. I worked for 15 years in the counseling field so I know what I am talking about.  Staff needs to be trained in these nuances because these are people's lives.  Good intentions can quickly lead to bad consequences. It seems like there is pretty high turnover at this agency which is never a good thing.  I am not sure how they are funded but IMHO it is time to look at something like a transitional tiny home community with units that can fit individuals with children where they can have a stay long enough to truly address barriers like access to housing.  Again, I am not picking on OSP but I think they need to address some of these issues.",

The first time I called in October the lady had a cab who was going to come get me and take me to a hotel because I left and didn‚Äôt feel safe. I ended up not leaving. Today I want to leave and a lady answered saying they don‚Äôt do that and just asked about a restraining order. That makes no sense to me when I‚Äôve called before and got real help. Sounds wishy washy. I am in nursing school, no kids, family lives 4+ hours away with no car right now and needed help. This time I was let down and am being abused. I can‚Äôt just be homeless.",

            "Title: Mixed Experience at Time for Change Foundation\n\nI spent two weeks at Time for Change Foundation after completing a program at Cedar House Life-Changing Center. I initially felt inspired by the founder, Kim Carter, and her story of transformation and dedication to helping women rebuild their lives. The facilities were very clean, and some staff members, like Ms. Amy and Rosaline, were incredibly kind and professional.\n\nUnfortunately, my overall experience was not what I had hoped for. I was upfront about my situation and needs but quickly realized I might have been too advanced for their program. Constructive criticism should aim to build someone up, but I felt belittled and unsupported.\n\nAdditionally, some staff displayed unprofessional behavior, such as openly discussing private client matters in the presence of other clients. This lack of confidentiality is deeply concerning. While some staff members were helpful, others, like Sherika and crystal, seemed more focused on personal matters than on helping clients progress.\n\nIf you are already self-sufficient or seeking a program that emphasizes growth and respect, this may not be the best fit for you. It appears they prioritize clients who are more dependent, possibly to align with their funding model as a homeless shelter.\n\nI hope they address these issues to better serve the women who turn to them for help.",
            "To any women ( specifically women with children),  contemplating on bringing your family to Time For Change Foundation for assistance, please read this before making any final decision. I was a client here from February 2024 ‚Äì June 2024 and I can honesty say they do not genuinely care about the woman or children in this program. All they care about is their appearance/ falsified reputation to the public to keep the donations/ funding coming in, and ignore the problems within their shelters, clients, and offices. My kids and I were wrongfully transitioned out of the program because the ladies I lived amongst did not like me, ( gossip,  immaturity, childish reasons), so therefore their solution was to get rid of me. I was 8 months pregnant with two young children ages 3 and 1. The director Ms. Vanessa informed me at 6 p.m. that I had to have all of our stuff packed, make sure I complete my chores in the morning, and be out by 9 a.m the next morning. Ms. Vanessa nor upper management  offered us any other alternative/ resources on another place to go. We were literally left to the streets. If it wasn‚Äôt for my former case manager Ms. Christal who stayed up all night to make sure my family and I would have a roof over our head the next morning, I don‚Äôt know what would‚Äôve happened to us. Time For Change accepts women into their program from all walks of life ( mentally ill, formerly incarcerated, recovering addicts) etc. and all of us come with issues. All women have to be evaluated at a mental health facility  while in the program. Though most women were prescribed medication, the women would not take their meds regularly resulting in mental breakdowns and cantankerous behavior. I was physically assaulted by another client at the shelter because my 3 year old apparently was crying to loud for her and she proceeded to get in my son‚Äôs face yelling at him to stop crying.   On another occasion, My 3 year old was also physically assaulted while I was away at their office. When I returned, I asked the babysitter they hired what happened and she told me she didn‚Äôt know! My son obtained deep scars on his face that are still present to this day.  I‚Äôve brought all these concerns to upper management and they never did a thing about it. They exploit women like us because they know that we are vulnerable and have no where else to turn for help.  Individuals who donate to them often come by the shelters to get a better sense of how we live. I specifically remember Ms. Phyllis ( upper management ) threatening us that if the house was not clean when the donors arrived we were ‚Äú going to get it‚Äù.  My family and I  haven‚Äôt been in the program for months and they are still to this day utilizing photos of my kids on their social media platforms to portray false narratives that are advantageous to their company. Time For Change Foundation has a beautiful mission statement and I believe at one point in time they had genuine dignity and pride in helping us. Now, it is tarnished by corrupt, money hungry, egocentric management/ employees that power trip and abuse their positions of power. To any women entering the shelters with your kids protect them ‚ù§Ô∏è.",
            "I‚Äôve been a client here since October 2022, which means I‚Äôve been here for 9 months. My story is just beginning but I‚Äôve had so much success since coming to this program. When I first got here, I came straight from jail four months pregnant. I had an open CPS case and though I didn‚Äôt know it at the moment, CPS was waiting for me to give birth to open a case on my unborn child. While being reconnected to the rooms of narcotics anonymous and working my recovery, I took life changing classes provided by time for change such as job development, 12 step, life skills, financial literacy, and relapse prevention, it was able to mold me into not only self sufficiency, but I was able to find my confidence again, I was able to be equipped with tools that will help me for the rest of my life, I now realize I am worthy, and I love myself today. While being here i was also able to keep my baby (which is now 5 months now) and I also found a beautiful job which just might turn into a career in the future. Soon I‚Äôll find my own place and be self sufficient. They‚Äôre main goal is self sufficiency but they provide so much more. They‚Äôre a support system if you don‚Äôt have one, they love you until you can love yourself, and motivate you and push you to reach your full potential. Thank you Time For Change for everything you have done for me.",

They said I was still using weed when I have 3 months not smoking and they said I tested positive for t.h.c and I basically told them I'm clean for the past months they didn't want me to do it again and just kicked us out and said they can't take me because I tested positive for T.H.C that's impossible because I've been clean for t.h.c for months . Not recommended",
            "What can I say? I thought this place was only for women but there I was, by my lonesome, seeking hope in an unprecedented time. This place helped me plug back into who I was meant to be. I was down and out on my luck and I felt that the whole world was against me. But, Time for Change gave me a renewed hope. They believed that I could right my wrongs. Provided me positive mindset workshops. Empowered my family and I. They assisted me when there were so many doors closed. They believed in me especially when I doubted myself the most.

            "Hope for homes is a shelter full of false hopes and dreams if you are a participant a lot participate doesn‚Äôt get the proper support  the food be expired they have no hot water or soap, staff doesn‚Äôt care to report important information the shelter is not up to code you have staff dating each other on 3rd  monitor kissing their lead staff threatening participants walking for the shelter was stressful and it kept me sick. They say the shelter got better I don‚Äôt see how in a month but I‚Äôll let the new people be the judge of that. üíô",
            "Intake to get into the shelter is meeting with a worker. Getting a bed and trying to get a locker took some time.About a month. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is at 7 AM 12 PM and 5 PM for dinner. Rather early. Each one offers a one hour time period then it closes the window in the cafeteria style window. They offer showers, restrooms, smoking area, which is rather large and tables, to sit on to eat like a park style.These tables need pressure washing to rid if germs and sticky tables Some of the workers are very nice and offer Good advice and help, While some participants say they haven't talked to the worker in quite some time. My Worker is grewt and helpful i think it depends hownmuch effort you put into this .. They offer a path to housing ,dealing with the house navigators as long as you have income or a job, they will help you based on your individual income, which is very nice. The staff that works here some Help on the female side and others on the male side, they swap  back and forth. Some are very helpful and nice. Others just see it as a job and are not really concerned about you. Personally, or you're well-being? That's the difficult part of being a homeless person in a shelter and dealing with other people  and there individual issues. As far as alcoholism, or drug addiction or mental health. Overall, it is a good place, and it's great to be here and enjoy a lot of the Staff that are very easy to get along with.They also offer Support group meetings\nTo help with transitioning frim shelter to living arrangements. Some staff do much while some others allow them to without putting forth as much .As long as you follow the rules, some made up as they go it would seem .Overall grateful üôè  to be here and look forward to regaining my dignity and housing to move forward. Thank you to the hard workers here who make it liveable .",

They lost all of my personal belongings, but at least she helped recover some of my personal mail. Hard to reach them by phone."

THANK YOU, lol",

But to those who are desperate and humbled by misfortune, the rescue mission can be the greatest resource. Their approach to alcoholism and drug addiction is one that has been proven to yield the best results possible in those whose odds are not good to begin with. I Can say from experience that you‚Äôll never get better treatment especially for free and it‚Äôs a cause well worth supporting.",
            "Two components to review.\n\nHomeless services:  The SBRM offers services to homeless people.  Food, toiletries & other necessities, counseling, referrals to other programs in the area, and a safe place to sleep at night.  This is a tightly run ship because in order to keep a diverse population safe there have to be hard and fast rules.  But if you're genuinely out of luck and need short-term assistance or better yet, hope for long-term change, this is the place to come.\n\nAddiction recovery services: SBRM offers a 1-year residential recovery program for men and women (separate locations) who desire (or with a nudge from the judge) long-term change.  This is not an easy program but it is unique in many ways, including that there is no charge to attend.  It is Christian-based and while you don't have to be or become Christian to come here you *will* hear about Jesus every single day, as experience has shown this is who changes lives.\n\nThis is more than a place to stay and detox. It's a comprehensive spiritual, emotional, psychological and physical transformative center.  Clients are guided from total dependence and oversight to increasing freedom and responsibility as they earn trust and demonstrate their commitment to real change.  Additionally, SBRM has strong ties with the local business community and those in the final three months of their program transition to jobs in the community in anticipation of their upcoming graduation.\n\nWhen you're done playing games and desperate for a change this is the place to come.  You have everything to gain and nothing to lose."

I am unsure of where Catholic Charities money is going. Because it certainly isn‚Äôt helping those in need. It was brought to my attention on several occasions the staff is known for stealing the ‚Äúgood donations‚Äù Pablo, Corina, Leslies, Cindy, Juanita, & Thalia . Are about the only staff members there who have empathy & genuine intent. Their rapid rehousing operation is a scam. Ask how I know. I got into it from Christina Atkins. Then thrown out 26 days later. They play dope fiend games. I don‚Äôt know how this place is legal. Systematic oppression at its finest. You are a number. Not a human. And a dollar sign. THEE shadiest place I ever seen. A bike got stolen my first week. They will switch out bike tubings and steal parts to bikes. I didn‚Äôt even know these kinds of petty thievery existed. Disregarding all the head banging from people nodding out on drugs in the bathroom. I forwarded a photo of the annex to a friend and was told ‚Äú I should go back to Mexico‚Äù interesting what do you do if you are American citizen? There was a stabbing in the annex during my stay.

            "I had an incredibly unsettling experience with Interfaith, where staff members Luis and Brandy made me feel judged, uncomfortable, and deeply triggered. From the moment I stepped in, it was clear that they treated me differently due to our skin colors not matching. The bias was painfully obvious and completely unprofessional for a place that is supposed to help people.\n\nBrandy failed to explain the services available and, without properly communicating with me, told Luis that I refused help‚Äîwhich was entirely untrue. Luis then took things further by accusing me of smelling like alcohol and marijuana, which was not only false but felt like a personal attack. I went to Interfaith for support, not judgment, and these accusations were deeply triggering, making me feel unsafe and disrespected.\n\nThe way I was treated was especially disheartening, as I am in the process of starting my own nonprofit (Broken Chains & Cycles) aimed at educating people about human rights and helping end recidivism. My mission is to provide the kind of unbiased, supportive services that Interfaith failed to offer. I want to ensure that no one feels the way I did‚Äîjudged, uncomfortable, and dismissed.\n\nThis experience has left a lasting negative impression, and I hope Interfaith takes action to address the unprofessional, biased behavior of their staff.

I asked her does your program assist in helping with security deposit and she said no and hung up on me. I called back and asked her for her name and she said her name was Jesse. She was absolutely rude. My children and I have been struggling and renting room after room for years now. I‚Äôm a full time working mama. We finally were chosen from the waitlist for a low income apartment and we are so excited. I‚Äôve hit every brick wall trying to find assistance for the security deposit to move in and this lady had no care in the world for anyone other than herself.

They called me about my need's and they visited, made a really good assessment, even replaced my refrigerator, and stove to a more energy\nefficient and it is really nice. They were courteous, and respectful and what I truly liked the most, is how much team work was a major factor.

To get help, you have to complete 20+ pages, have a valid ID, social security card, bank statements, proof of income, and rental agreements along with any other information they require.

They have zero regard for actual people and don‚Äôt care what your income to expense ratio is they just have numbers they chose and if you make more than that they won‚Äôt help you. This is strictly a program for people already receiving benefits in some way. They don‚Äôt actually care about struggling families at all. Instead you‚Äôre labeled based on your income. You‚Äôre a number not a person. Don‚Äôt get your hopes up for help if you‚Äôre not already receiving benefits because you‚Äôll get labeled and denied.

            "People were smoking in the line and once they got in, I noticed at least one person continuing to smoke. He was at the table that is for assisting the homeless so I'm assuming he was one of the workers which makes it worse. A worker should know better than to smoke in a shelter. That shows a lack of care for the homeless because they are forced to breath the smoke if they want to sleep there.\n\nThey didn't provide any beds, or pillows or blankets or anything. We were told to sleep inside the gated area but outside the building in the cold. I was told that I could pick a spot on the concrete floor to sleep on. I expected a shelter to have beds and blankets so my only option was to sleep on the hard concrete floor in the cold. My back started to hurt so I decided that I was better off on my own.\n\nOne of the homeless said they sneak in weapons and that he has a weapon on him now. He also said that they will steal from each other. That tells me that the security to get inside is really poor. The homeless guy said he likes this shelter because they are less strict than other shelters. Personally I would prefer a shelter that was more strict like no smoking in the sleeping areas for example. I would never go back.",

            "Recent Feburary 2025 Review.\n\nFor Donors and Organizations I highly encourage you send one of your staff or yourself in the shoes of a normal everyday homeless person and see what's really going on with your money here, join the programs and stay for a week, and you'll see the issues I highlighted below.\n\nDon't fall for a \"Scheduled Tour\", show up unannounced and ask to see the property immediately or simply start walking around and checking it yourself.\n\nThe Owner or whoever is on the Top Level needs to start being personally involved much more often, because otherwise the only solution is Investigation and Exposure.\n\nThe Staff needs to be cleaned out Top to Bottom for the most part, while Ex-Residents have an idea of how it operates, they shouldn't be employed post-release, as this gives them a sense of ownership and favoritism that isn't in the Midnight Missions best interest of Solving Homelessness.\n\nThe end goal of a homeless shelter should be to close down once it accomplishes its goal.\n\nPhotos/videos of the street, lines, and eating times need to be published so people see the real issues. On the surface it appears to be a very good organization, but they would have better luck burning and tearing down the entire block and the ones around it. The pictures you see online is a place that simply does not exist in reality, it is vague clout chasing.\n\nThe Handling of California Government Assistance is also very sketchy as the staff wants to be abnormally involved in facilitating things like GR,CalFresh,MediCal, if investigated, it's possible you would find abuse of these funds and benefits for the lesser capable individuals.\n\nPortion Control, Food Quality, Food Preparedness, Food Safety, Could be heavily looked upon, Sometimes there is too little, sometimes they give you enough for five people. There's no sense of balance or rationing.\n\nI understand they need to serve a large amount of people who are at times not the best mannered, but if someone doesn't start running this place that actually knows how to be assertive they are just contributing to the problem /behavior and enabling it.\n\nIt'd be better to close this place down, restart it entirely, and open it up with better management. Whoever is running this place has no clue how homelessness actually works and how to fix it, they are simply keeping the problem in limbo.\n\nThis is a For-Profit Homeless Shelter, meaning they want to keep this Machine going as long as it brings income.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to spend a couple days, weeks, or whatever time is needed to come in with a different approach as people are -Reliant- on this Shelter and that will not push them to go try and make a change.",

I was also able to sit down with the families and have breakfast with them. They were very grateful for the love and support the staff and the program itself had offered them. Fast forward a couple of years later, I am blessed to now be working here as part of the team that creates a space filled with hope and the love of God for all who walk through our doors. I am grateful for the generosity of the community and donors who generously share their time and finances to keep this program running.

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",

I show up to drop off my friend and the women who working the early day shift were super rude and kicked us off the property. I tried to explain that we called the day before and the information we were told but the women working at that time kept cutting me off, saying, I don't care what anyone said to you, get off the property. I tried to explain that my friend isn't safe on the street because she is disabled and unable to defend herself or run away from any possible predators. The lady working told me that she didn't care, that check in time is only 3-5pm and to get off the property or she would call the cops.\n\nWe were not being loud. We drove into the property in a quiet little car, no music playing or anything. We called when we got there. Got shut down and hung up on the phone first and then were sitting in the parking lot trying to figure out where to go when the women worker came out and started demanding that we left the property.

So we did what they said, and now both his Medicare and MediCal have been cut off.  He tried o make a doctor appointment and was told that he has no insurance.  Instead of the 3rd he will now receive a much smaller check \"about the third week\" of each month.  We tried to talk to Social Services and they said to call Social Security. Social Security said to go to their on line site, which is no help at all.  Now what?  Called mental health, but can only leave a message that is not answered.",

            "I submitted an application for a wood voucher in December and have heard nothing since, though I stopped by two days before Christmas, placed a call and sent an email today. It's understood that time is required for this, but a return call seems appropriate in this case considering that we have had several inches of snow fall. My experience with TEACH prior to this has been fairly good, the thrift store is excellent and everything moves smoothly in the food line, but trying to actually apply for something seems to be very difficult for some and no problem at all for others. This is disappointing, and I hope to hear from someone soon, given that I heat my home with a woodstove and have been getting along by the kindness of a friend's friends. At this rate I will be unable to comfortably suggest TEACH as a place to obtain help when it's truly needed.",

I even reported it to the ombudsman. There was also another report of abuse for the same foster home at the same time. Everything was swept under the rug nothing was done My children are still being abused right now.",

Spam e-mail and cans of Spam.  Not good!  If you work there and are reading this... Smile!  :)  I'm only mentioning the Spam to make you smile.  Thank you!"

The bay doors are able to open up... don't know when this usually happends...  There is no 'gym sweat smell' as the floors are laminated. This is a GREAT thing.

W&F is cramped with weight machines\n\nBathroom with small locker room is good and 1 shower is a tad in an odd place.\n\nBathroom has always been clean\n\nYoga in the main center as of Aug2022 Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

The first lady who looked like a bar tender said they don't serve food here. Old female came out of nowhere trying to interrogate me. Old female kept saying \"this place is members only.\" They both thought I was under 21. Asked for my ID a couple times. I'm 32. I was exploring the neighborhood while my car was getting its windows tinted down the street. They old hag said \"you're going to have to walk there\". Right after I said I don't want to walk all the way to the Safeway shopping center since I have disabling tinnitus. As I was walking towards the door she literally said \"go on get out\". She's thinks I'm a dog. I have never been treated this bad in my entire life anywhere in a \"place\" besides when my family was abusive. This shows how dark this place probably is. Long story. \"She said this is private property.\" I continued walking down the street trying to explore. She was outside staring at me. I turned around a few times and kept staring arms crossed when I was still 100 feet away from this land. She was taking pictures of me too. I had to walk back from where I came since there's no stores down past this place. I'm walking back and she's still video recording me or taking pictures. She literally said \"yea come on, come on!\" To antongonize me. She thinks a Mexican doesn't stand a chance?

Then again it is faith based so it's makes since a church probably has it under its wing. Since I'm not a religious person when I stayed there the directors would give use the choice to step out during services. If we would like to sit outside, so that was legit due to alot of places that are faith based they force their 'clients' to attend them, mandatory. Otherwise, you were living there much longer. It was sad due to the fact that some religions find sacrilegious to attend or even think about a diff. Religion.

            "I recently visited interfaith in Sonora,ca. A lady named Deborah informed me they could help me get a battery for my RV I just needed to bring a quote for the battery so I went to Napa Auto parts. Then returned to Deborah office whom upon my first visit stated that she to was once homeless so I thought she cared about me and my struggles since my of wife's  recent passing. 33years married to the love of my life. But thanks to living in toulomene county where most of the citizens are a product of in breading it really should come as no surprise to me that she is a liar and has no interest in truly helping anyone. So beware if you ever need help I would not recommend going to them for assistance. Thanks to Sargent passuqie (misspelled) touolueme county sheriff giving me a ticket for out of date registration. fine $160.00 which I just bought in January of 2024  and registration cost $785.00 the registration should not have been due until January of 2025. But thanks to the seller having lied about his wife having paid to keep vehicle on non-op. Again a citizen of toulomene countys (embreaded population) I am done with living in a society that has no compassion for anyone but them selfs,where lying is okay and the welfare system is a joke and if your a Senior Citizen in this county (good luck) because no one cares about you not even the ones displaying the cross that my Savior Jesus Christ died on as part of their business advertisement is all fake misleading which offers nothing more than creating a false sense of caring to for it's citizens. As for the Sargent for toulomene county again (my guess is a product of embreading) hello new State Law effective 2024 States it is illegal for officers to ticket a person for simply having expired tags for 60 days but on the start of the 90 day they can legally issue you a ticket the exception is if a driver has committed some other type of motor vehicle infraction can they issue a ticket.. know the law if your in a position of enforcing the laws.  Oh it's no superise that Debroah and The fine Sargent choose to profile the less fortunate by demonstrating what can happen when you are a product of embreading in toulomene county.  That's it I'm done you win have lived a fair life but I can't take it anymore so I'm going to say goodbye and pray for God's forgiveness for my selfish actions. Both Deborah √†nd the good Sargent should not be in a position where they can cause people to loose hope and cause people to take their lives. Especially in positions where they have a duty to protect and serve the citizens (weather imbread or not) all people deserve better treatment no matter to their situation may be good luck and good bye oh I know who cares anyway right.",

I mentioned the Hi Jolly big camel mosaic. \"Unique collection,\" The Getty Museum. I have some resources and have gotten a lot of media attention. For more images, see my somewhat redundant Pinterest boards. I also have a large Critter Collection, 45 pieces?, some big! Thanks to everyone's hard work. Best, Farrell  I only sold a couple eggs, the first at the old Miramar in Montecito, CA,  One sold at a benefit for a food bank here for $1,250, so, if HOWA came up with a buyer in that range, they could sell one and keep all the money. The White House sent my wife one of their autographed, wooden Easter egg roll eggs. It was quite a surprise. Thanks again! The quote is from my upbeat novel. I had a writer's file with The Tonight Show back in the day!",

            "Attended a many virtual meetups over 4 yeara and 3 in person gatherings. Over time this group is shrinking. In my opinion, between the control freak they hired to monitor the virtual meetups and the cliques they've formed, repelling every newbie or anyone who isn't already established, it was a depressing abusive experience. They publish their virtues and list a litany of things they claim they believe in, but they help very few.  They talk but rarely execute their plan. I came alone and after 4 years I left alone. There is -no- community. There are only closed little groups that ensure no one else gets in. I wanted to have travel buddies while I looked for property to buy. My neighbor is coming with me. If you'd like companionship \"Community,\" join a club on meetup that shares your interests. HOWA can only depress you and make you feel unwanted. No one deserves that.üíï",
            "I have been following the people who run HOWA since 2008, and have met many of them over the years.  I have been using some of the resources they offer, mainly the virtual caravans and information on Utube. They are some of the most generous, helpful and good hearted people I have ever met. Their philosophy of inclusion and non judgment while still providing a safe space is admirable.\nA wonderful resource for those wishing to learn more about the nomadic lifestyle and connect with others who have that interest.\nThey are trying to help people who are falling through the cracks in our social safety net, people whose income is not enough to pay for housing and who are on the edge of homelessness.",

So of course everybody has an opinion of what Christians should be doing or how they should be conducting business. But don't know any other place that offers a homeless shelter a day center, a nightly Christian service, a hot meal, food bags, clothing, hygiene kits, celebrate recovery, a sober living program, and a transitional housing program. And they also work with CDCR and Geo called to stop program and yet they get very little money from the city, county, state or federal if any at all. It's all generated by the services they provide to other facilities and/or through donations",

From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",

Did those monies come from a victims fund?\n\nWhat was worse was the message that thoughtless action sent which was \"you may be the victims, but we are the team\".\n\nI hope they rethink such activities in the future and think of the victims before themselves.\n\nAll I can do at this point is hope for the best, wait and see.\n\nI will be back to update this review when all is said and done."

            "I have been going to this clinic for 5 years.  They are better than any MD. They spend all the time needed with you to help you understand what you need to know and feel better. And everyone at this facility is very friendly.  Also, sympathetic to your individual needs.  I think very highly of this organization. Thank you for all you do! And God Bless! UPDATE! June 11th! I would like to add, for the last several months every time I call the clinic no one answers the phone. No matter how many times a day I call. And I don‚Äôt call unless it is absolutely necessary.",
            "They never answer the phone in the medical department!  And when u leave a message you‚Äôre told you will be returned a call within 24 business hrs. Very frustrating.   Don‚Äôt get me wrong they are sweet and kind during scheduled appointments,  but If you need anything done after that, good luck trying to get a hold of them. Best bet is showing up to ask for the help you need.",
            "Excellent facility for anyone who is having a hard time with health, food, or basic daily essential needs.  Theres a medical clinic here, showers, and social workers. Primarily for low income or homeless, it's a great place to help those in need. People have always been very nice both staff and visitors. A great start and program helping people get back on their feet.  We need more of these here in Marin. Awesome!",
            "The services like having an address I can receive mail at, do my laundry, shower, get great medical attention, need clothes, receive a bag of food, meet friends in similar predicaments and get counseling that will help me  better my life make this organization a staple in everyone's life and something that makes being human beautiful."

My 6-year-old child was called names and even pushed at Giliad House (I even had to wait for the police at 11 at night on the street). After this incident, we were actually kicked out on the street without further help to find another place for us! I was intimidated and threatened so that I would not carry our terrible story to the masses !!! The director of Giliad House did not provide us with other accommodation and ignored our requests for any help."

I just tested positive for it.\n\nAs for the food a lot of it is white and refined and does cause severe constipation for much of the community living at COTS, many chose to eat once a day to combat against it.\n\nThis place has a very low standard for cleanliness, multiple residents among me complained to the director about the cleanliness of the bathrooms.\n\nIt was dangerously bad. I feel 2 stars among all this is a nice review.\n\nIn my opinion, stay out of cots at all costs, because you may not believe it, but the MRSA here could in fact cost you your life.

They are taken advantage of women in need and most of the positive reviews are the favored residents and friends of the director I have filed reports with dhcs/dfeh THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HOMELESS WHOM THEY KNOW HAVE VERY LITTLE OPTIONS IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TAKE THEM THIS ‚Äúprogram‚Äù is a set up",
            "The place is infested with mice and roaches!!! The directors refuse to call pest control all they do is bomb and put down boric acid which obviously is NOT working. boric acid is extremely poisonous and there are a lot of young children living there which is concerning. It‚Äôs $400 for you and $100 per child. Some residents were paying over $800 to live in filth with bugs and rodents. It‚Äôs extremely sad. Me and my child were sick our entire time at love a child, we didn‚Äôt get better until we left. I had to take my child to the emergency room because a roach was stuck in their ear and my child was admitted and had to be treated for an infection with antibiotic's. The director dismissed me from the program because I had to stay overnight in the hospital with my child but honestly I was relieved because I did not want to return! They threatened to throw all of my belongings away if I did not retrieve by the end of the day. They wrote me up for missing church although I provided them a doctor‚Äôs note stating that me and my child were sick. I constantly got written up because the rules are unclear and certain rules only apply to certain residents. The staff are residents but they get away with things that other residents get written up for. They‚Äôre allowed to let their children play outside unattended with no shoes or proper clothes on but if another resident does that they are written up. The staff residents will literally write you up for anything just because they can. This program is obviously taking advantage of vulnerable women with children. Staff residents are obvious drug users but directors do not care. They do not drug test you upon acceptance into the program so they basically let anyone in. They say that they do random drug tests but the residents I talked to on a daily basis while I was there said they had never been drug tested during their time there. One resident even bragged about leaving to go smoke Meth. They do not provide any housing resources! They do not do case management! All they do is take your money and give you a bunk bed in a filthy cottage ingested with roaches and mice. BEWARE",
            "I was fleeing domestic violence, my abuser is actively searching for me. I was dismissed from the program for being in the main office at 7pm.\n\nI was a late intake the day previously and had support with my domestic violence advocate. I was extremely tired and didn‚Äôt catch all of the information. I figured I would find out more the next day. I went to sleep, left the property early on the morning- before 645a to get to work. The website says that they help with transportation to work, THEY DONT. It took me 3 hours to get to work via bus and BART for a 3 hour shift, and another 2-3 hours to get back. I was gone all day.\n\nI called the program prior to arriving, letting them know I was gone at work and making my way back. I arrived back to the property around 645p and entered the office.  I went in to ask questions about the program, how to fill out my schedule, and what I needed to do for classes, etc. I left quite early in the morning and knew I missed information so I was just asking for tips.\n\nI am not familiar with Pittsburg at all and wanted to know more about the are, how to get around, advice and things like that. As I was talking to the woman, we talked about God, my journey, etc. I felt so much better. All of a sudden a woman named Courtney whom I have never met before or seen before came in to say that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be in there. She spoke to the woman as if I were not there and said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt let these people in here just tell them no. I saw the camera.‚Äù It was extremely rude and unwelcoming and I calmly explained that I was a new intake, and wanted to know more information and I took it upon myself to come in and ask what the requirements were, what I missed, classes.\n\nThe woman, Courtney said I needed to leave and could finish tomorrow. She then started speaking down to the new employee. This new employee is part of their work adjustment program and only made $10 for the WHOLE 8 hour shift. I calmly explained again to Courtney that this woman was just trying to help. I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence and I‚Äôm in an unfamiliar area. Courtney said someone would call me and explain. I don‚Äôt believe that because nobody called me that day, I actually called in twice, and nobody knew who I was.\n\nI explained to Courtney that I didn‚Äôt appreciate her tone and asked how they would get ahold of me since they failed to do so‚Ä¶ and she quickly glanced at my work schedule and was like ‚Äúwe can have an appointment with you on Tuesday at 130p. I said that‚Äôs fine but I want my DV advocate there. As I‚Äôm trying to pack up to leave, she says, that Love a Child has no gates and I‚Äôm free to leave whenever I want. I explained that that was not what I wanted and I was grateful to be there.\n\nI told her I wasn‚Äôt feeling comfortable talking to her, explained I had a social work background, and legal background. She asked what does it have to do with the conversation. I explained that she was escalating the situation, I have PTSD. She got visibly upset, and said I was being insubordinate and I was dismissed from the program. I asked her to please call my advocate and that any discussions and decisions need to be made by her as my PTSD symptoms were exacerbated by her.\n\nShe proceeded to cal police and told them I was there refusing to leave property. I said alright thank you, please call my advocate. They could not get in touch with my advocate.\n\nAs I was walking back to my unit (where I had only been there one night), she approached me saying I was free to pack my stuff. I was already going to grab my stuff, what was the point of her approaching me like that? To exacerbate my symptoms even MORE?\n\nApparently Courtney goes to Bay Church Concord, I also attend there. I‚Äôm so disappointed in how she handled the situation. This is not how a Christian behaves. I slept on the street last night. Had nothing with me and it was 50 degrees last night.\nIsaiah 54:17 is what gets me through. But I am so sad and hurt by the lack of support especially female support.",

This program lacks compaction and respect for there residents and the office needs lots of work Shannon needs to get out the office and Courtney needs to open her eyes.

This is a lot for someone who has zero income. They said that they would help even if you could not pay . But for me there‚Äôs too many requirements that made my decision about staying here. One requirement that surprised me is that If your dr has prescribed meds to you, you have to be on them to come into this program. Which was a no for me because I was in the process of changing drs & the medication she had me on induced diabetes so I had to stop taking them. If you want to be in this program you have to take all meds prescribed by your doctor no excuses. I would not recommend based off how much you have to pay just to be provided a bed."

            "Calli House is a great shelter. The staff there care for the individuals that reside at C.H. They have counseling  available, group/art therapy, meals and food, showering and offer bed space if available. I've noticed since being at Calli House, all staff push clients to look for jobs, go to school , help with health and housing situations but you must want to succeed and get better too. I'm grateful for this place. Definitely has forever changed my life for the better and taught me a lot.",
            "I've gotten to know Calli House well over the past many months and I see that it is a place that really tries to help all of the youth that some through it's doors. Every staff tries to be compassionate and kind, while encouraging youth towards their own set goals. It is a great place that deserves much praise.",
            "I lived at Calli House in 2012 and for me that was the best opportunity to move forward in my life. After a couple months of living there I joined the Job Corps program where I completed two trades and caught up in academics. Since joining Calli House and transitioning into the Job Corps program I am now a Job Corps graduate and a current student attending community college in pursuit of my AA Degree. I give praises to God for guiding me through this program. I think programs like Calli House give young adults and adolescence the opportunity to develop themselves and set solid goals. However, it ultimately starts with you and what you want for yourself. ‚ÄúYou get in life what you have the courage to ask for.‚Äù‚Äï Oprah Winfrey",

            "People were smoking in the line and once they got in, I noticed at least one person continuing to smoke. He was at the table that is for assisting the homeless so I'm assuming he was one of the workers which makes it worse. A worker should know better than to smoke in a shelter. That shows a lack of care for the homeless because they are forced to breath the smoke if they want to sleep there.\n\nThey didn't provide any beds, or pillows or blankets or anything. We were told to sleep inside the gated area but outside the building in the cold. I was told that I could pick a spot on the concrete floor to sleep on. I expected a shelter to have beds and blankets so my only option was to sleep on the hard concrete floor in the cold. My back started to hurt so I decided that I was better off on my own.\n\nOne of the homeless said they sneak in weapons and that he has a weapon on him now. He also said that they will steal from each other. That tells me that the security to get inside is really poor. The homeless guy said he likes this shelter because they are less strict than other shelters. Personally I would prefer a shelter that was more strict like no smoking in the sleeping areas for example. I would never go back.",

            "Recent Feburary 2025 Review.\n\nFor Donors and Organizations I highly encourage you send one of your staff or yourself in the shoes of a normal everyday homeless person and see what's really going on with your money here, join the programs and stay for a week, and you'll see the issues I highlighted below.\n\nDon't fall for a \"Scheduled Tour\", show up unannounced and ask to see the property immediately or simply start walking around and checking it yourself.\n\nThe Owner or whoever is on the Top Level needs to start being personally involved much more often, because otherwise the only solution is Investigation and Exposure.\n\nThe Staff needs to be cleaned out Top to Bottom for the most part, while Ex-Residents have an idea of how it operates, they shouldn't be employed post-release, as this gives them a sense of ownership and favoritism that isn't in the Midnight Missions best interest of Solving Homelessness.\n\nThe end goal of a homeless shelter should be to close down once it accomplishes its goal.\n\nPhotos/videos of the street, lines, and eating times need to be published so people see the real issues. On the surface it appears to be a very good organization, but they would have better luck burning and tearing down the entire block and the ones around it. The pictures you see online is a place that simply does not exist in reality, it is vague clout chasing.\n\nThe Handling of California Government Assistance is also very sketchy as the staff wants to be abnormally involved in facilitating things like GR,CalFresh,MediCal, if investigated, it's possible you would find abuse of these funds and benefits for the lesser capable individuals.\n\nPortion Control, Food Quality, Food Preparedness, Food Safety, Could be heavily looked upon, Sometimes there is too little, sometimes they give you enough for five people. There's no sense of balance or rationing.\n\nI understand they need to serve a large amount of people who are at times not the best mannered, but if someone doesn't start running this place that actually knows how to be assertive they are just contributing to the problem /behavior and enabling it.\n\nIt'd be better to close this place down, restart it entirely, and open it up with better management. Whoever is running this place has no clue how homelessness actually works and how to fix it, they are simply keeping the problem in limbo.\n\nThis is a For-Profit Homeless Shelter, meaning they want to keep this Machine going as long as it brings income.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to spend a couple days, weeks, or whatever time is needed to come in with a different approach as people are -Reliant- on this Shelter and that will not push them to go try and make a change.",

They give zero cares about people in need. I signed up to get help with keeping me in my place! I‚Äôve STILL!! Never heard back from my worker! Or her supervisor! It‚Äôs been WELL! Over a month! I was given an appointment  to come back to bring two forms that they never told me I needed before hand! Only once I got there. However, I brought back the next week at the day and time I was given! Guess what! I sat there from 10:00 that morning until1pm!! ! Not my ‚Äúworker‚Äù or anyone else  for that matter ever! Came out to see me. So I of course left!! Only for me to call back a few hours later to THEN!! Be told that she actually had NEVER!! Even came to work that day!! So I sat all that time for nothing!! Like  No one knew this?? Not even the front desk? Really!?!? Then when I was finally given her number, So  called, called several times,  leaving several messages! Was very polite and professional! Yet! She still has never called me back. Till this day!! Also the days I had come in looking and hoping for help! Person  after the person!  Would come in, go to the window and tell the same type of stories to the woman at the front desk! How they had been waiting for weeks to hear back about one thing or another! Or how their landlord has been waiting on something that was supposed to have been handled and how it‚Äôs been over 3/4 weeks of calling and coming by with nothing! And these women at the window NEVER!!! Seems to know ANYTHING!! I watched this happen hour! After hour! Same stories. These people do not care about anything but getting a check! And as long as they have no one to check them!! Hold them Accountable!! They will continue to do the same thing which is nothing!!! And  get paid for it! It is the worst organization I‚Äôve ever walked into. It‚Äôs the  people who are truly in need that is suffering because of it. Because if their supervisors continue being busy only being their friends instead of a true leader! Then they will never change this behavior. I still have never met my worker. I‚Äôve still never spoken to my worker! Only the ‚Äúintake worker‚Äù. However, I‚Äôve left messages after messages after messages. No return phone calls,  no letters, just  no care at all for the Crisis in front of them. . I‚Äôve explained to her over the phone Just how pressing my situation is! And  Absolutely nothing.  I mean It must be nice to get a paycheck just to simply clock in!  And I‚Äôm sure every one of them! In their interviews talked about how they love helping people.ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm sure they either started or ended with that LIE!!! HOPICS! Is not for the people!! It‚Äôs where they all come and gather! Hang out with their coworkers! And get paid. I seen and heard SOOOOO! Much more then! But I honestly can‚Äôt tell it all here. Only if someone of authority would call me!! I would LOVE!! To tell them everything I‚Äôve seen and heard! Even from others I know personally. HOPICS!! Is HORRIBLE!! And it‚Äôs unfortunate. They don‚Äôt even realize or care to that it‚Äôs because of the people in need that they even have this program/job. They win though. We lose. The ones that has been helped! Trust it was ONLY!!!

My wife is in the hospital, facing gallbladder surgery, and we called and told Susan, their director what was up, the only thing she gave a damn about was that stupid rental agreement, and not a tinkers damn about the fact my wife was facing a high risk operation. There really needs to be an inspector to go in and see their habits in food preparation, and how it's served. No gloves,T or hair nets. That troll that works in the kitchen, ( Terry), who is mean and always puts her nose where it does not belong needs to find another line of work. She has proven to be anything except a Christian. She sent my wife on a wild goose chase after ordering me to not park in their parking lot, and when I confronted her, she smirked. Never once was I ever so tempted to hit a woman!

If we would like to sit outside, so that was legit due to alot of places that are faith based they force their 'clients' to attend them, mandatory. Otherwise, you were living there much longer. It was sad due to the fact that some religions find sacrilegious to attend or even think about a diff. Religion. So honestly that's the only reason I could stay there because if it was forced upon me, that's just not cool. I'm just grateful they let me stay a few months when I needed."

They do absolutely nothing to provide the help people need. They just perpetuate the problems of this town. The workers were clients themselves, but where is the actual social work experience? They don't dispense soap for the bathroom, and people don't wash their hands, nor kids. Plus roaches, plus mold, and some staff member is allergic to bleach, so we're not allowed to use it at certain times. No wonder so many people were sick for weeks on end. They stopped accepting donations. You're treated like an idiot or a child at times. They let people scream and curse at their children. The rules are enforced depending on who is working. My case manager Jessica lied to me about giving me an extension of two weeks. She told staff that I was still leaving as scheduled and it caught me off guard. This place and its employees need an undercover to investigation. Please, please. See how this place is ran. You would be appalled. How does one report this place?",

            "This place is so wrong. And they lied to us. They took somebody a young man that worked hard to detox and then come to their center to get help. They accused him of all kinds of stuff the first night and they said he had to sleep in the basement with the homeless And drug addicts down below. They never really talk to him to find out what really happened. They just accused him. They told me they were a Christian based place. This does not sound Christian to me. I went and got him the night they told To sleep in the basement. They degraded him. They treated him like an animal, and he did nothing. I.Brought him home and now they‚Äôre saying they saw him on the street sleeping on the ground getting up and acting funny the next morning and they‚Äôre going by hearsay. Let me tell you this. This is the worst place you could send your child. He‚Äôs been cut down so bad that I am concerned and worried about him and I blame it all on this place. Thank you so much for lying to me and my family and giving us hope for him. he‚Äôs trying so hard to do everything right he was so happy to be there and you say it‚Äôs mandatory that he sleeps in the basement for two weeks. There‚Äôs something definitely wrong with this program that you would send someone down there with homeless people drug addicts and it‚Äôs freezing cold. I‚Äôm sending all this information to my attorney that my husband and I have had for years and we will just see how far you get with what you Have done to my son. I‚Äôm pretty reasonable person, but I‚Äôm not now not with you lying like you did if I could, I would name every single one of you that did this to him but I Can‚Äôt if I‚Äôm going to start a lawsuit against you.",

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",

Help people to get their lives back on track. This place allows people to sleep all day and get comfortable with their situation, instead of helping them they allow people to stay down and be ok with being homeless.  I don't understand this, they should participate and help out while they stay there. Help them build structure and help them get jobs. This place is pretty much a kick back spot and do whatever you please kind of place. I think giving people a warm place to lay their heads and a warm meal is truly awesome, but that can't be all there is to it , right? They definitely need a program to help them get their lives back in track. That's just my opinion.

            "I'm going through some problems right now I'm not with the mission at the moment but I can say when I was there in 1997 they helped me out a lot with clothes good clothes not hand me down clothes I was on the program there for 11 months I had got an argument with some of the staff I got booted out but that's a long story otherwise the mission is a good place to rebuild your life",
            "I have been living at the mission at Kern county and will not go back I have been lied to, and lied to by staff. My name has been slander, by staff members because I am an asset to my community. I had an accident in my pants and was told I could not shower for two hrs. Then I was kicked off the property for a dirty test that was never there. And I have that proof\nThis place also wasted a lot of donations they receive like drinks they got poured down the drain so they can keep the recycling money staff members load up there vehicle like they were going shopping at a grocery store the donation clothing if it new gose right to there program if it old then it to the homeless.",
            "The mission isn't to bad u get coffee and three square meals and an address to use, if your on drugs they got a program for u to try but if your cause trubble they will give u the boot sober or not, it's not a hotel it's a homles shelter some staff are cool others are ehh u gata figure out who's trying to get u the help u need",
            "Staff there is so genuine and it's nice to be around people that care about others without an ego or hidden agenda. At the same time, there are people in our community that need our help. Volunteer, donate, time resources, and solutions."

            "It's a safe place if you mess around u will get the boot sober or not, church ppl come and give out some good snacks, the shower situation is probably the worst part beds are nice and u get a storage bin. They have cameras unlike the mission so if some one steals your stuff they get the boot, they do help u get housing but it takes time",
            "Do you like jail? Do you like being bossed around? Do you like adults demanding and commanding other adults around? They hype this place up so damn much and they pretend and act like they want to help! But, my service dog had to fight off other dogs that we're not service dogs the whole two weeks that I stayed at this 5 star resort!!! Further more everybody is constantly fighting and arguing the theft is unreal and the staff looks down and talks down to the homeless constantly everyday!!! For dinner they feed you half a pb&j sandwich, a banana, and a yogurt if you like to eat like an adult should then this place is not for you I am 63, I have a service dog and I disabled and they treated me like dirt and kicked me and my dog out and let the young kid stay I now have vet bills for my service dogs injuries and I am on the sidewalk with nothing and no where to go I hope and I pray that i find a way soon that flood took me far away from everything I knew and when I called them at 2 pm on a Friday I was told to tough it out and to call them on Monday one more thing almost everybody there was on drugs its an absolute mad house",

He told us that he felt that, as he was crying out toGod for help, God clearly spoke to him that Teen Challenge was where he needed to go.\nHe is doing well now, has a job he likes and able to help meet the needs of his family.",

            "Staff are dedicated and amazing. Wish more could be done to improve their building so that more people can be helped. They have had bingo fundraisers for years and that really is more than enough to improve this place. The community has been coming in with lots of food donations so not sure why Dorothy's place is so tiny for a giant community.",
            "The women and men who dedicate themselves at Dorothys Place and The Learning Center next door are amazing individuals.  They work selflessly everyday to help the less fortunate people that the rest of the world would rather forget.  Thank you for being unsung heroes.\n\nDonate your time, money, or clothing sometime.  No matter the amount; it all makes a difference."
