            "if you ever think about coming to this place find somewhere, ANYWHERE, else to go. the staff are rude and mostly the women staff treat it like they’re still in high school, choosing certain families to like or choosing certain families to “bully”, they give expired food from YEARS ago and don’t even care, I’ve seen a “chef” give my brother and his friends 3 year expired cookies without even checking the date or apologizing when brought to his attention. when told about the things that go on in the gym like theft you are told “it’s a shelter what do you expect.” which no family wants to hear. after a certain time they charge you around $100-$300 to stay there longer which is pretty unusual considering it is a “homeless shelter” the people in there are disgusting and very unsanitary and when staff hears about it you are yet again told “it’s a homeless shelter what do you expect.” When in the sprung building there was multiple people who were sick which was also unsanitary. if this isn’t enough proof that you shouldn’t come here at all than I don’t know what is.",

With the support  that was given to me was priceless and actually God used this and showed me what my purpose and calling is..helping others in their struggles love others no matter what\nEveryone has their own opinion and story about URM I couldn't be more grateful and thankful.\nIf you walk in our doors at URM and keep your eyes fixed on what YOU need to do where God is trying to take you, you will have a successful outcome.A big shout out of THANK YOU ALL WHO DONATE.\nURM couldn't of helped me if it wasn't for generous people.\nNow I get to give back because you helped this \"ONE\"\nGod bless"

            "People were smoking in the line and once they got in, I noticed at least one person continuing to smoke. He was at the table that is for assisting the homeless so I'm assuming he was one of the workers which makes it worse. A worker should know better than to smoke in a shelter. That shows a lack of care for the homeless because they are forced to breath the smoke if they want to sleep there.\n\nThey didn't provide any beds, or pillows or blankets or anything. We were told to sleep inside the gated area but outside the building in the cold. I was told that I could pick a spot on the concrete floor to sleep on. I expected a shelter to have beds and blankets so my only option was to sleep on the hard concrete floor in the cold. My back started to hurt so I decided that I was better off on my own.\n\nOne of the homeless said they sneak in weapons and that he has a weapon on him now. He also said that they will steal from each other. That tells me that the security to get inside is really poor. The homeless guy said he likes this shelter because they are less strict than other shelters. Personally I would prefer a shelter that was more strict like no smoking in the sleeping areas for example. I would never go back.",

            "Recent Feburary 2025 Review.\n\nFor Donors and Organizations I highly encourage you send one of your staff or yourself in the shoes of a normal everyday homeless person and see what's really going on with your money here, join the programs and stay for a week, and you'll see the issues I highlighted below.\n\nDon't fall for a \"Scheduled Tour\", show up unannounced and ask to see the property immediately or simply start walking around and checking it yourself.\n\nThe Owner or whoever is on the Top Level needs to start being personally involved much more often, because otherwise the only solution is Investigation and Exposure.\n\nThe Staff needs to be cleaned out Top to Bottom for the most part, while Ex-Residents have an idea of how it operates, they shouldn't be employed post-release, as this gives them a sense of ownership and favoritism that isn't in the Midnight Missions best interest of Solving Homelessness.\n\nThe end goal of a homeless shelter should be to close down once it accomplishes its goal.\n\nPhotos/videos of the street, lines, and eating times need to be published so people see the real issues. On the surface it appears to be a very good organization, but they would have better luck burning and tearing down the entire block and the ones around it. The pictures you see online is a place that simply does not exist in reality, it is vague clout chasing.\n\nThe Handling of California Government Assistance is also very sketchy as the staff wants to be abnormally involved in facilitating things like GR,CalFresh,MediCal, if investigated, it's possible you would find abuse of these funds and benefits for the lesser capable individuals.\n\nPortion Control, Food Quality, Food Preparedness, Food Safety, Could be heavily looked upon, Sometimes there is too little, sometimes they give you enough for five people. There's no sense of balance or rationing.\n\nI understand they need to serve a large amount of people who are at times not the best mannered, but if someone doesn't start running this place that actually knows how to be assertive they are just contributing to the problem /behavior and enabling it.\n\nIt'd be better to close this place down, restart it entirely, and open it up with better management. Whoever is running this place has no clue how homelessness actually works and how to fix it, they are simply keeping the problem in limbo.\n\nThis is a For-Profit Homeless Shelter, meaning they want to keep this Machine going as long as it brings income.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to spend a couple days, weeks, or whatever time is needed to come in with a different approach as people are -Reliant- on this Shelter and that will not push them to go try and make a change.",

They run the shelter called the Willows in Canoga Park and the monitors there take all the donations and also go in your belongings and either steal them or throw them away they say and I had to get a whole new wardrobe and had barely any money to do this. Thankfully a friend has helped me. They barely housed actually just a few people in the shelter. It was a nightmare what I went through there for 23 mos and then didn't get housed. I did everything I was suppose to do yet they through me out and older single woman onto the streets right before Christmas in cold rainy weather. They promised me a sec8 voucher from day one but then said they lost my application when how could they when it was entered into the computer system.

I when back to DPSS to speak to the social worker who help me and told me that they should help you out because your an emergency need of bed because I have a child with special needs. No they still denied me and my son to get that help my son and I needed the most.

But you must put the work in and do what you need to do, you can only get help if you are truly helping yourself first. They're not just going to hand you everything on a silver platter, you have to meet them halfway and I promise they will come through on their end. I highly recommend PATH.",

            "PATH is doing an excellent job in helping the homeless, the only problem is that it's way too small and underfunded to really make a difference. We would need at least 20 PATH housing facilities to effectively get a handle on the homeless housing problem. Mind you it is NOT in the interests of the powerful real estate industry to effectively solve the homeless problem. As long as there is a housing crisis, large property owners will be in a position to gouge working renters out a major percentage of their income just to occupy their substandard units. The problem is that many working people who are currently being gutted out by wealthy landlords have been convinced to scapegoat the poor and homeless as opposed to organizing for their interests. The homeless are hardly without their problems too (yes I know just about the understatement of the year). Many times the homeless are encouraged to scapegoat other marginalized groups of people at the expense of their long term self interests. I have passed out voter registration forms in the past to some of the residents with mixed results. A major convenience in voting for the PATH residents is that the polling station is just across the Hollywood Freeway at Helen Bernstein High School, on election day. The point I would like to make to the residents of PATH is that they might not believe in their ability to make a major difference but, there are powerful interests whose major concern is you doing just that! This is to the point that they are willing to spend far more money to politically suppress you, then they have ever spent on your health care, education and, housing.",
            "Worst place ever for a Veteran to get help.  I only receive 'General Relief income and am unable to work.  All they wanted me to do was to increase my income (by using their office as a employment referral) which I am waiting on Social security Disability Income to be able to afford housing as that is my only option.  Their employment referrals are a insult to anyone.  One of their so-called Employment Counselors )Jason) referred a Veteran I know to a temp job serving as security at a Wal-Mart with several other people who were to be paid at the end of the shift.  But when it came time to be paid the person who hired them (not Wal-Mart) didn't pay and in fact kept putting it off again and again.  When the fellow Veteran called Jason  he wouldn't ever call back.  when the Veteran went in person to the Path offices Jason avoided him.  To make matters (somehow) worse the man who went thru Path to hire the people he didn't want to pay was/is a friend of a female employee of Path.  In the LEAST Path is EXTREMELY questionable in their ethics.  Since I wasn't able to increase my income in the three month they did give me a extension in their program but did absolutely nothing for me but keep me on the Client Roster to no doubt show potential donors to help donations but provided me no service for locating housing.  I did on my own with ZERO help from Path.  Don't give them your time much less your donations."

I was given an appointment  to come back to bring two forms that they never told me I needed before hand! Only once I got there. However, I brought back the next week at the day and time I was given! Guess what! I sat there from 10:00 that morning until1pm!! ! Not my “worker” or anyone else  for that matter ever! Came out to see me. So I of course left!! Only for me to call back a few hours later to THEN!! Be told that she actually had NEVER!! Even came to work that day!! So I sat all that time for nothing!! Like  No one knew this?? Not even the front desk? Really!?!? Then when I was finally given her number, So  called, called several times,  leaving several messages! Was very polite and professional! Yet! She still has never called me back. Till this day!! Also the days I had come in looking and hoping for help! Person  after the person!  Would come in, go to the window and tell the same type of stories to the woman at the front desk! How they had been waiting for weeks to hear back about one thing or another! Or how their landlord has been waiting on something that was supposed to have been handled and how it’s been over 3/4 weeks of calling and coming by with nothing! And these women at the window NEVER!!! Seems to know ANYTHING!! I watched this happen hour! After hour! Same stories. These people do not care about anything but getting a check! And as long as they have no one to check them!! Hold them Accountable!! They will continue to do the same thing which is nothing!!! And  get paid for it! It is the worst organization I’ve ever walked into. It’s the  people who are truly in need that is suffering because of it. Because if their supervisors continue being busy only being their friends instead of a true leader! Then they will never change this behavior. I still have never met my worker. I’ve still never spoken to my worker! Only the “intake worker”. However, I’ve left messages after messages after messages. No return phone calls,  no letters, just  no care at all for the Crisis in front of them. . I’ve explained to her over the phone Just how pressing my situation is! And  Absolutely nothing.  I mean It must be nice to get a paycheck just to simply clock in!  And I’m sure every one of them! In their interviews talked about how they love helping people.🤦🏾‍♀️ I’m sure they either started or ended with that LIE!!! HOPICS! Is not for the people!! It’s where they all come and gather! Hang out with their coworkers! And get paid. I seen and heard SOOOOO! Much more then! But I honestly can’t tell it all here. Only if someone of authority would call me!! I would LOVE!! To tell them everything I’ve seen and heard! Even from others I know personally. HOPICS!! Is HORRIBLE!! And it’s unfortunate. They don’t even realize or care to that it’s because of the people in need that they even have this program/job. They win though. We lose. The ones that has been helped! Trust it was ONLY!!!

            "This place has a lot of rules. Coffee is served at 6am. There are two big screen TV and the morning news are shown. It can be difficult to enter their programs. Overall it is a good place to start one's day.",
            "Moved in last Tuesday so far I like it , really clean ,charging stations, day room with big tv, vending machines , clean showers and bathrooms and big dorm upstairs. 3 meals a day. Security on site.",
            "Great place, staff is friendly and the case managers very respectful and resourceful.",
            "This place is a lifesaver! It's a process to get in (you need to take a TB test then orientation) but I had a bed and breakfast for the next 6 months while I went to school and they refer me to another program that got me an apartment for $50 a month!\nI've been in my own place for 4 years! All I have to do is just let them visit me for 5 minutes every month and that's only to check up on me to see if I need anything like a haircut voucher or a box of food.\nThe only thing is that the curfew is at 7:30pm and you have to leave after breakfast (which is 7:30pm, if I remember right), unless you work or go to school. If you're on drugs then you probably won't make it, even with those simple rules (from what I saw). But if you're serious about getting on your feet and getting some stability, then St. Vincent is the perfect place for you!\nShout out to my caseworker Sharen Cervantes! Thank you for all your help, I'll never forget you!",

St. Vincents Cardinal Manning Center took me in and I was able to continue my job and save a good amount of money. Progress not perfection is what it's all about.

            "I recently did a “spring cleaning” and had a lot of clothes in excellent condition (some with tags) that were too big on me and kids clothing that my children wore a few times and outgrew.  There were also some worn shoes, kids toys and books.  I called around and confirmed that this place is currently accepting used donations.  When we got there the lady took a glance at the box of shoes and said she couldn’t accept anything because of the condition.  Admittedly the shoes were not super clean (since they’re shoes) but the clothing was all washed and in excellent condition. She didn’t bother looking thoroughly and rejected everything.  We spent a lot of time coordinating this effort and going to DTLA from Marina del Rey only.  It’s incredibly frustrating since some of the people there would’ve gotten a real wardrobe upgrade from the condition of clothing they had on.  We found another nearby shelter that happily accepted everything, so all was not lost,  but I wanted to share this unfortunate experience.",

It is like any scam institution as I'm reading people donate because Alexandria house tell the people they help people in need. The true is otherwise. Our family needed help to relocate and they can loan money to people in need, I contact them  but they did not reach out. Fortunate I am a working descent person I can manage to keep on going. If you ever need help keep praying and work hard do not wait around for any institution like this one they wont release the money people donate for the benefit of people in need. If you donate probably the help never reach to people in need. That is my experience.\nEdited\nThe response is mislead to make you believed they won't gives loans. They do, the person who grands them told me they do.( I do not wamt to give names away) Obviously by their response they do not delivered the help to the people in need. Also it is just a  loan without interest that the person who asked have to pay back anyways it is not like they give money away.\nThey knew my situation they promised to contact me on a certain date. The people are Israelites who collected donation and I guess they kept them to themselves\nWatch out who you support. That all I can say. The social help was not in anyway to help the people in need\nAgain is my experience all I want the people to know If needed  help keep praying and keep working hard there is someone out there that will help NOT this institution. If you donated please make sure you donate to institution that care for people in need. I had donated in the past thinking that one day I will need help and now that I'm in need I can see that NOT all the institution out there are for the benefit of the needy one. Fortunate I found this institution that open my eyes to see the truth\nTruth will set you free",

            "Warning Long Review But Worth The Read:\n\nGrab your popcorn…\n\nTerrible experience with this non profit.  I reached out to path, for assistance in finding a home, security deposit assistance, and utility assistance. I needed moving assistance because I can no longer stay at my current residence due to a severe knee injury that I had. I live on the top, third level of an apartment building with no elevator and I am at risk of injuring myself due to my having to use the stairs daily. Everyday I feel pain and physically struggle due to my disabilities and where I am living. At times I cannot walk.\n\nI received an email from  “Becky Breda” a specialist there. We were emailing and she told me to call her. Soon as I called her she instantly was aggressive and said I need to pay my own bill, only referring to my utility bill assistance request. She said I need to pay my bill myself because I make enough money. She was yelling at me through the whole conversation. She spoke for me and spoke over me whenever I tried to speak. She was extremely unprofessional and was too aggressive to speak to. I remember asking her “why are you being so hostile towards me?” I had to hang up the phone because I could not get a word in. She kept saying that I received assistance from them last year, but I never did. She kept saying things that weren’t true about me it was very unacceptable. She said, “I work, (referring to herself) I budget, do you budget!”\n\nThat conversation was traumatizing. I acted on a grievance with Path due to their employee. What Path decided to do was have there grievance councilor give me a call and have Becky‘s supervisor on the line.\n\nThe grievance counselor and Becky’s supervisor just heard me out and said that they will talk to her pretty much. They also said that they will have another employee follow up with me to see if any assistance can be given to me. Another employee reached out to me “Gabriela Valdepena” but had inaccurate information about me as well, however I could correct it this time. She said she would call me back after she gathered some more information. She never called me back.\n\nI reached back out to the grievance department to request that she call me back. Then, she called me back. After we finally spoke again, Gabriela Valdepena told me that I could not be helped with a security deposit. This was the only thing she tried to discuss with me about. She said because I am not homeless or at risk of being homeless.\n\nI told her I am at risk of being injured or possibly passing away due to my living conditions and my injury, so I don’t see how I am not eligible. She ignored what I said and continued to say I am not eligible for assistance. Then she said I can receive the security deposit from my current residence. That was irrelevant information because of course I know that and that’s not going to help me move I need security deposit assistance in order to move now.\n\nAfter she told me that I cannot be helped with security deposit assistance she tried to end the conversation. I said “Okay, what about the utility assistance?”  She said “you cannot be helped with utility assistance because you have to have a loss of income.”\n\nAt this point, I knew she was not trying to help me with anything. However, I went ahead and asked one more thing because she ignored discussing that as well, I said can I be helped in finding a home. She said “we can send you leads” I said OK thank you. I’m still waiting for the leads. This was my experience with Path.",

An the workers in that place are super lazy. They don’t truly care about homeless people, just in it for the check. My worker takes forever getting back to me with finding apartments etc.The supervisors are even worse. They will not be on your side with anything when it comes to complaining about they’re workers work ethic. And anything in general they work when they feel like it. They have a second building that the clients can’t get to, instead they meet with you at the old office which is very idiotic. It’s very frustrating specially when your trying to better your life. If I can give them 0 stars I would. If your thinking about this program I hope you reconsider. Cause they will not help you in need or when push comes to shove. Only when they feel the need to.",

They even had a music studio back then where we could make music and taught us how to make beats and record using protools. They even helped me get a job and my first apartment at 18. I miss those days love y’all. ❤️ This place definitely shaped who I grew up to be man the drive was real. Can’t even thank y’all enough.",

            "It's such a shame I had to give this place the lowest rating because honestly, I wouldn't give it even one star if I had the choice. This place is supposed to be a safe haven for the community, but it's failing miserably. They don’t respect people’s belongings, and their schedules are super confusing I always missed breakfast because schedules were different every time. I ended up having to sleep on the streets just because I didn’t make it back in time when in reality they would give a way my bed. Not sure why they hated me so much . It’s disgusting how some people still manage to abuse others, even after they’ve been through so much. Honestly, they need to fire the entire staff and bring in people who really care and aren’t just in it for the donations.",

To make matters worse, she sent me to Skid Row by myself - a single female and TAY youth. You would think they would have some remorse. Especially considering that most youth here do not have family, or a safe place to call home, but they didn't. There is so much potential for this place to really help youth. But the staff abuse their power, and have control issues. If I could give 0 stars I would. That kind of behavior from grown women to youth is completely unacceptable.

            "It might as well be a minimum security prison, but your children can come with you. This has to be the worst place to go when you're trying to get back on your feet. They do not follow their own rules, they treat everyone like peasants, and their caseworkers will not help you. They say they will help with getting into contact with sources with Housing, Employment, and Mental Health, seeing as they have a contract with DMH (Department of Mental Health - Los Angeles). They charge the county for everything you do, down to a toilet paper roll, and yet they have no problem giving out free food to their employees from the residents cafeteria, which in-turn effects the residents. They restrict everything you would consider to be a normal function of life. In example: You cannot leave your children alone in ANY situation, including letting your child sit at a table quietly while the parents retrieve their meals. If there is a single parent situation, you must subject your child to second-hand smoke exposure in order for the parent to have a moment to themselves. I suppose they are encouraging quitting. A seasoned smoker would know that in stressful life situations, it makes quitting even harder. There is nothing for parents to do with their children in the center, but you can walk the streets of Downtown LA. There was a children's playroom, which is closed and removed all books and toys, and provides no opportunities for families to live a normal life. The staff is truly, terrible. It should be that in order for someone to retrieve a position like theirs, they should have to live the situation the residents get to experience everyday. The staff clearly doesn't care about their responsibilities or their assistance they offer during your orientation. Certain rules get more enforced over others.\n\nA harsh reminder about this particular organization, they discriminate. It is evident in how the staff reacts to certain people. There is favoritism among the staff and residents. They know about dangerous situations some of the children are living in continually.\n\nOne thing that I really wish would resonate, the fact that these residents are put here because they need help. Imagine if you will. Your family, for whatever reason, goes homeless. Upon starting your day at Zahn house, the breakfast announcement is around 6:45AM and runs till 8. If kids have to take a bus or train to school, most kids will miss breakfast. On your way home after work/school, you have to make it back at least before 5:30PM to make it in time for Dinner. If you're late, you only have till 6 to consume your \"healthy\" meal before the staff starts to close off the cafeteria. With that in mind. What would happen if you did miss dinner. You would have to wait till 8PM to use their vending machines during snack time. If you have no money, and no means of providing a dinner for your kids, its too bad in the eyes of Zahn. Your child now has to be punished just because their parent failed to return in time, god forbid there is traffic in DTLA at 5PM. You have to let your child starve all night. That's 6PM to 6:45AM of no food.\n\nDo you know what that does to a parent? To the point where you feel so hopeless, you wait till everyone is asleep to go into the bathroom and cry. Do you know what that does to a human being?\n\nEver consider what that kind of situation does to a mental health patient?\n\nThis place needs help. Real help. Not just \"caseworkers.\" J&J need to leave. - you know who you are.",
            "This place was so hard to be at emotionally!! It brings tears to my eyes!! Meaning hard to be at seeing my children there!!! However it was such a wonderful place for me and my family to be..when we had absolutely no where to go!!

The one in charge was ok when she wanted to be..and most of staff was nice!! Especiallys Maria..in charge of cooking in the kitchen..I remember my daughter's birthday and her cooking for us!! And singing Happy birthday!! Just her!! That is a memory I will never forget!! Just not being able to give your child a party and roof!! and feeling like the world is on your shoulders!! Just for a stranger to care that much!! Meant Everything!! They led us to transitional\nhousing in Westwood!! And helped us get jobs!! In 2018 I am now on my feet working and a roof over our heads..thank you zahn .of it weren't for you .idk where we would be today .thanks to beyond shelter as well..it wasn't easy lol!!

            "And guess what I just read this morning that the funding for homeless programs is about to go up with this increase they’re saying audits will be conducted consistently because many of these organizations have fail to provide the data on clients and the program progress. I was invited to become a client of the inside safe program through first 2 serve in November of last year I was told that I will receive all the things that they claim to provide their clients with in their mission statement. I’m on my second case manager, and all either one of them has managed to do is gather my personal information for their records every day, I signed an attendance sheet and when I leave, I have to sign out and when I get back, I have to sign in. I feel as a client that I am helping them more than they are helping me and that’s facts. In October of this year, the program director grace the Motel, where I am residing with her presence and told me personally that she was working on having each client in permanent housing by November that was the last time I seen or heard anything from her I do a lot of reading so I’m aware of the funding that these organizations receive therefore I know after they pay for our room and the breakfast lunch and dinner that they have plenty funds left over for the services that they are not giving the rules and treatment of both employee and clients is bias and not in favor of the Black Client or employee. I praise Rev. Reed for taking on such a big role and in the beginning I had nothing but swell things to say about the first 2 serve organization you can check my past reviews so where along the way he drop the ball or has placed it in the wrong hands a full year after entering this program, I am still homeless seeking permanent housing and My life skills are as they were when I enter the program",
            "I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding my experiences at two First to Serve. I want to make it clear that this letter is intended to outline the events I encountered in a factual and objective manner. I have taken care to ensure that the details are accurate and reflective of my experiences. I also want to acknowledge that while I was not perfect during my time at these facilities, I believe the treatment I received was neither appropriate nor justified.\n\nInitially, I stayed at the women’s domestic violence (DV) transitional shelter run by First to Serve, seeking safety from an abusive relationship. However, I observed troubling incidents during my time there. Specifically, one of my roommates frequently consumed hard liquor on-site and acted aggressively towards myself and others. Multiple women, including myself, raised these concerns with staff, only to be told to stop complaining and to be grateful for having shelter.\n\nSubsequently, I was transferred from the DV shelter to the residential women’s rehabilitation center down the street, reportedly due to my complaints and for using marijuana. During my time at both facilities, I diligently documented any behavior I believed was unfair, inappropriate, or potentially illegal.\n\nAt one point, during a patient meeting with other survivors and staff, I shared these concerns directly with Reverend Richard Reed. I provided specific details, including the dates, people involved, and suggested improvements. The following day, I was informed by Reverend Reed that I would be relocated to a different facility because, as he put it, I was “too educated” to belong there.\nAn employee, whom I will not name for legal reasons, was assigned to transport me to the new shelter. At the end of the drive,  I learned from her that Reverend Reed had instructed her to drop me at the center of Skid row at nighttime alone, with no resources or support. She indicated that my removal was a direct consequence of voicing my concerns during the meeting. Reverend Reed reportedly believed I needed to learn a lesson about questioning his authority.\n\nThe experience of being left on Skid Row at night was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. I was a vulnerable woman in a dangerous area, alone, without money or a place to go. I begged the employee not to leave me there, but she felt compelled to follow orders. She later told me that she quit her job the next day because she could not reconcile the inhumane act she had been asked to carry out by the Reverend. .\n\nRecently, I encountered this former employee, and our conversation confirmed the events as I remembered them. She recounted how Reverend Reed and another staff member (a counselor with a missing front tooth, a disheveled look and  literally filthy woman whose name I will remember,)  discussed the decision to leave me on Skid Row and admitted that it was a punishment for speaking out about the conditions at the shelter.\n\nThis experience left me deeply shaken, and I now feel compelled to share my story. I believe that no individual seeking refuge and safety should be subjected to such treatment. It is my hope that by bringing these matters to light, the organization will take steps to ensure that no one else endures a similar plight. That no one is defeated for voicing their rights.",

As soon as they sent me the food requirement card I rushed over there just to be told that people show up at 7 am. Even though I was there 20 minutes before closing time. It took all my gas to get to this dodgy area in L.A. and I had my child with me . I'm a veteran and was told there is a food program for veterans.  They ignored me about it and never once wanted to verify if I was a part of their program. This is the only food pantry in L.A. that ever turned me away. They will be reported and audited. If you scroll down you will see an African American man was turned away from this place as well. That is illegal.",

I lost 15 pounds the first 2-3 months I was here, no insurance, no transportation  just 4 walls in an SRO to call home. Everything was on a life survival need nothing more.\n\nI reached out to St Francis food bank which I found Googling resources. They responded right back (as you need to register with them and get a card to become a client at the food bank). If it had not been for them I would not be here today. Though I have to budget my own food there are things I can't afford (fresh bread, fresh vegetables and fresh fruit) these are a few of the things I look forward to weekly.

Talk to some residents in the meantime and one of them mentioned that this shelter is meant for homeless drug users and I definitely don't fit that subscription.

            "It felt like such a special powerful moment and such a blessing to meet Giovanni and Stone at the Dream Center. Their team is doing truly outstanding work in Los Angeles county for all the victims and families and children impacted by the fires. I could go on and on but I’ll just say that I can tell they are truly the exemplar of what it means to step up and show up here in a city like Los Angeles. These are the true heroes that are saving people day in and day out with the resources, hope, and faith they provide. Even the smallest donation and act of kindness can go a long way and just from Giovanni’s kindness and Stone’s prayers, I could tell that they are truly here to uplift families  and communities in LA during these darkest hours. Los Angeles is not an easy place to live, and with these wildfires it has impacted many throughout the city in more ways than one. Let it be known on Google that Giovanni and Stone are amazing and their efforts to be there for those in need is really … I don’t even have the words. It made me really emotional meeting them. I’ve heard of the Dream Center almost everyday since the fires started in LA and I have been having trouble making my way out but finally paid a visit with my son. And it was really incredible to see in person the work they are doing and to meet them face to face. I was not sure if the radio was hyping up the Dream Center but it is not just hype. Go there and you will find what the city of angels is all about. Its a place where your dreams can begin. There is hope and light on the other side of all this. And tonight that’s what I found. Thank you Giovanni and Stone for praying for me and my son 🩵",
            "The Dream Center is an amazing ministry to the homeless and hurting of LA; they are reaching out daily to bring food, water, recovery, and hope. I was blessed to be able to serve alongside some of their team, and it's obvious that they have a passion for the people of this area.",
            "Staying here for short term missions, they do incredible things here. The hospitality is amazing.",
            "There is no other church that has done more for the community than the Dream Center. For years and years, they have been servicing the community and have provided food, shelter, mentoring programs, drug and alcohol services, foster care services, and an incredible message of hope and love. God has really been active with the mission and purpose of this church, and I am proud to have been coming here since I was 13, and I am now 37. Pastor Mathew has truly provided a place of incredible worship and a place where adults and kids could both understand God's message and could be involved in fun activities all around. I hope others can really help contribute and go out there and volunteer and donate as I have seen the growth and expansion of this church since covid. This church never sleeps and never closes cause God's mission is always available to those in need, and that's what this church has been doing for years.",

Overall good but some of the staff are disrespectful and treat you like a prisoner and almost as if your stay is a problem, meanwhile they get money for every person that stays per bed. Thankful for the roof it gave me for the short time I needed but I’m glad to be gone, this should be a last resort even down to specific shelter, always look elsewhere. You will feel like less of a person coming here and I don’t think that’s how it should be.",
            "If you are just getting out of jail or prison, this place will be an easy transition for you. Because they will treat you as an inmate as opposed to what you are, which is, A CLIENT\n(Also, Staff thinks they are correction officers)\nStaff had MANY people utilizing ONE shower and made up a rule that the \"MOBILE SHOWERS ARE FOR INTAKES ONLY\" The correction officers made up this rule so they didn't have to clean the mobile showers. The correction officers also love to bark their orders instead of having civilized conversation. I had a pos case manager that  wasted my time by not keeping our appointment TWICE and this was intentional. I arranged my whole day around this appointment only to be written off (intentionally)causing me to miss the 9pm curfew SINCE I had things I HAD TO GET DONE THAT DAY. I missed curfew and had to crash on the beach. Boohoo yeah anyways point is these are the types of people in your corner. This is a terrible environment NOT good for your mentality.\nOh yeah they also told me I couldn't get another case manager and proceeded to make up reasons as to why it couldn't be done. (More bs) Anyways if you're accustomed to the south central mentalities and or jail or prison, you'll feel right at home here. If you are willing to trade your self respect and dignity for a bed and shower, this place will be a breeze for you.",

The staff do not listen to anything that the residents say they only push their objective and could care less about how you feel. I am still a current resident here and I am going to start recording conversations that are had in this program and posting them online and shed light on what really going on in here. In hopes that this program will be shut down, they only care about the money and not how any of the people who go through this program feels",

They have security it’s a family owned business this faith-based their churches not not the Shelter the Shelter does not try and push that on you, but you can’t help but want to go to their service. It’s very very good. I had never been to a church like that I was I grew up. My mom had us in the Lutheran church but this spirit field anointed blessed and covered angels. Everywhere on that property is the best place to go. It was amazing I felt like I was at a five star hotel and I’ve been all over the world Ibiza Japan and I’m telling you this was very it was nice  and the bus stop is like 2/2 a block away you’re right in the thick of it if you could survive South Los Angeles and appreciate it people working their butt off trying to survive having to have three families and one apartment just afford rent. it’s insane so that’s what that’s what that is over there and it’s getting gentrifying fast. It’s gonna triple  value if it hasn’t already so I my counselor was Dr. Cromwell they got me situated into a hotel call project home key if you have Asmar diabetes you qualify and they don’t check just a little bird told you OK I didn’t know until I was literally two blocks from the place to the hotel on my way to the hotel when the lady said so, which, which one of these do you have and she like rattled off a bunch of stuff  in order to be qualified to move or I just like diabetes because I’m borderline I’m hypoglycemic and they don’t check you know so you’re not committing a crime if you don’t have it but seriously within 60 days you should be in your own Hotel ? Yep Yep 60 days and then from there if you have a job you can get rapid rehousing where you get your own apartment  when Apartment paid for for two years while you’re getting your head together I just came from ministry when I showed up there I had been in that kind of a situation since 20 1919 when I chose to go into a faith-based Residential treatment center in Pasadena, which they don’t call it that it’s like a huge it’s a three-story hotel for women only  and you get over 100 presents each Christmas worth over $100. You are showered with your little heart desire but you’re there to find out which ailing you and me I want to know what’s going on because I just did a nine year domestic violence, relationship went to jail got all charges dismissed  anyways that’ll be in my book anyways. Yes Testimonial community love center highly recommended.\nKimberly Andrzejewski"

There are security cameras and security guards and doors are locked  from 10PM to 6AM for safety and security reasons.\n\nAlthough the Director didn't like me the intake worker I interviewed with fought to get me emergency housing and stood in my corner fighting for me the whole time. (EXPLAINATION: I just got outta an abusive relationship and 5 months outta rehab so I admit, I'm a hot mess with a lot of baggage and some real ******* thinking y behavior but I'm getting better everyday.)\n\nThey provide a food bank every Friday and Saturday.

It's open to all at no cost to you. (see details below)\n\nEvery day at 530-600pm they serve takeout dinners. 7 days a week.\n\nEvery Wednesday they collaborate with the FOOD COALITION for haircuts (every other Wednesday), showers, clothing, medical y dental advice, references y treatment (medical interns overseen by licensed doctors and nurses), toiletries, etc...\nThey have a free optometrist truck to get an exam y glasses\n\nInquire with the coordinators to find out what day what services like showers, glasses, and haircuts for example are scheduled.

I dont ask for perfect or anything out of the reasonable but wow do the staff and services here set a new low.

Barbara B, Kim C, Nita C...oh my god. The most apathetic, ineffective, self-serving, inconsiderate, dishonest social workers I've ever encountered. Diann Horton tries, but isn't able to maintain a decent staff. Ryan I, Program Manager, is disconnected, disinterested, and thoroughly lacking in the ability to handle escalated issues. They all turned a blind eye while a man spiraled into paranoia, ultimately murdering his young wife in the most brutal fashion you can imagine (Google: Valentino Gutierrez and Tiana Alfred). They allow anyone into their shelter...be it psychotic criminal, or 80-year old with dementia, and couldn't care less at the outcome (I couldn't believe the elder abuse of this woman that went on!). At one point during my stay, we were robbed and the dorm was ransacked while we slept. These people insisted that the woman responsible would be welcomed back, despite residents still missing purses, and trying to get new IDs, SS cards, etc. They didn't care one bit that we were all traumatized. As far as Kim C. this woman will tell clients she \"loves\" them, but then won't return a call, email, or text for WEEKS, and then when she does, she tries to turn the blame on the client. THIS SORT OF TREATMENT OF THE HOMELESS EXACERBATES THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS ITSELF! I've never in my life been treated so poorly as I was by Union Station. We're given assistance, but expected to sacrifice any modicum of pride or dignity we have left.\n\nThere are many mentally ill clients at Union Station. It's not a transitional shelter. There are clients who've been there for as much THREE YEARS!! What does that tell you about their \"Housing\" abilities! They have written on their vans \"Employment Housing and Recovery,\" or something. They do NOTHING to help with employment. NADA. That's a joke. They have a bulletin board with outdated flyers on it. They do NADA to try to help the drug addicts and black-out alcoholics. It's insane. Truly, a nightmare.\n\nWhatever you can do to avoid this hell-hole...do it!\n\np.s. How funny that our nighttime thief (PH) has given Union Station 5 stars! Just yesterday, it appears. And another thief has reviewed Union Station favorably not once, but twice, and mentioned God, while being known by all as the biggest thief there (BM). Also, AN EMPLOYEE (DB) has left a positive review! How does THAT help someone decide if they should risk their physical and mental health by staying at Union Station?!",

Not just completing a procedure.\n\nI am active duty Navy, and several of my family members are Veterans. HNT sees many Veterans, and non-Veterans.

            "Wish I read the one star reviews before now. I would have donated my sons clothing to a more professional and appreciative organization. I agree with others that it is hard to reach someone  and receive timely responses for those considering donating. The person in charge of donations always seems in a rush to get off the phone as well. I specifically donated to this organization based on the cause, as I had many bags (5 full  bags to be exact)  of very nice baby clothing and shoes that were basically like new. It’s now been over a month and I have yet to receive donation receipt, which they claim would be sent via mail or possibly email. I am also not a local resident of the area. It’s terrible the way our world and so called organizations operate nowadays. No such thing as professionalism, courtesy, or customer service anymore.\n\nI later drove back to Elizabeth's House to further inquire about my receipt and encountered that majority of donated items are picked up and sent to a local thrift store called ACTS Thrift Store. A staff from the thrift store comes to load up a pick up truck.",

No one will pay attention to you, care about you, guide you, or help you solve your problems. During the pest control on Tuesday, my clothes were stolen by the staff. I reported it to the manager, but the manager and the staff colluded. I reported it to the person in charge, but he didn't care either. There was no way to complain. I sent an email to the higher-level shelter supervision department, but there was no response. I was retaliated against and kicked out without any reason. Especially that Job, he was arrogant and rude, chattering non-stop. Ask him for help and consultation. It's as if you are his enemy, causing trouble for him. He is very impatient and tells you to go to Google, go to Google. He has no humanitarian spirit at all.",

            "welcome, prisoner!\n\non average, one person died every month. The RIP poster only lasts a few days to hide the truth.\n\nevery staff member has the education of a 4 year old. I’m not exaggerating! The wicked little black lady higher up is unable to count to 10! Its a kind of dystopia created when 4-year-olds are told to manage a group of people: inconsistency, wrong judgement and blame, no memory, no long thought, no peace, absolute disharmony.\n\nPrison lights, prison wake up times. TSA bag checks. Music blasting everywhere, tenant and staff alike. Chemical bug spray, always causing confusion. No air-flow, to increase disease. No sunlight for most beds. Zero “outreach”. No case worker. At one point, there was a great person working for “access point”, trying to save people, but that person was quickly fired. The management plays all the games it can to act like they are a working organization. Anyone who’s too smart or good will be fired. It’s the only way for it to survive.\n\nThe location has only two liquor shops nearby, otherwise, you must transfer at market to get anywhere. By the time you get to Safeway to eat or quench your thirst, you’re tired. You can’t have a bike either, someone will break or steal it (park at Caltrain on weekdays). You aren’t allowed to store food or drinks, which makes it impossible to be comfortable. The food in the shelter will kill ya. Great breakfast, but in general it will spike your cholesterol, blood/sugar, and fat. After which, you’ll want to nap, which is the goal of such a place: to be stuck in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThe entry/exit system is a complete failure, causing people to lose their bed no matter what. It’s likely intentional, to cause more disarray, distraction, and to avoid staining their record to make it seem like no one is leaving and more are coming. It’s better to just run away to another county. Just about any suburb will be better.\n\nOnce you are gone, they will act like they don’t know you, and keep your mail, even if you were the best tenant.\n\nThere are better managed jails ‘n prisons.\n\nThis is the worst place I’ve been to in the world, and I’ve been through 10+ countries in Asia, from city to countryside to remote. This is hell.\n\nI highly recommend anyone seeing this to just try another county. Any county! SF is amongst the worst.\n\nIf you cannot escape SF, go to The Sanctuary on 8th and Howard. That is by far the best shelter of the three choices provided by General Assistance. If you choose this wretched path, I pray for you.\n\nIn the end, they are stealing $700 from each person, from the county, preventing them from being able to move to a proper house, by preventing housing assistance with constant misinformation, neglect, distraction, obfuscation, and any other trick. They will never tell you that you could get $700 if you just had your own residential address.\n\nRun. Run to any county’s housing authority. Say you lived on the streets in whatever county you chose. Just get out. Life is not worth wasting here. And if you can, take as many people as you can with you."

And in order to stay long term, you must be referred by another agency (\"GA\"?). furthermore, at 4pm, the crisis team fire truck / ambulance vehicle go around collecting people and dropping them off on time, so you must be there before them. first-come, first-serve is indeed brutally unfair to the unfit.\n\nfood is \"meals on wheels\" microwaved in plastic meals.\n\nwater from a water fountain at night (past 10pm), or the cooler in the kitchen during the day.\n\nthey store extra baggage, and check all baggage taken in (not stored).\n\ndrop-in is super simple: no registration. it's so simple and anonymous, it might be a security problem! all they ask is for the name. it's good 'n bad. i dig the simplicity.\n\nbathrooms are industrial, with showers just hot enough in March.

There's not really a curfew here, staying out overnight is not an issue as long as a person is conducting themselves in a responsible adult manner, and the staff seems to be truly understanding. What impressed me most coming in on Friday was that the staff mingles with the clients constantly as if it's one unit working towards whatever goals one is trying to achieve. There's absolutely no authoritarian attitudes directed at anyone here. It's a great warm and healthy place for a person in need of these services to come and regenerate and heal."

            "If you’ve got General Assistance, this is your best bet. DO NOT go to MSC South. Once you get here, maybe you can call Crisis HOT team to place you in a shelter not listed by GA.\n\nThere is only one person that is conscious of the homeless’s reality and actually doing something: the white female caseworker. There used to be a guy sitting in the men’s dorm that was conscious too, mediating conflicts, checking for overdose, but somehow he got fired or moved. The rest are just there, doing whatever bureaucratic duties hidden within tiny offices. Though, by doing nothing, the staff here is much better than the folks at MSC South! These people actually work together at times, even if no one really gets along with the out-of-touch authoritative African boss.\n\nThe bathrooms will forever be full of drug-users, some nights with all of the stalls full. Drugs seem to be allowed in the bathrooms…\n\nFood is meh. Luckily the location is good, with St. Anthony’s nearby, but, that means traversing the Tenderloin, and seeing and being reminded of the horrible state of the environment. The food store next door is expensive, taking the homeless’s food benefits. The inability to store food makes life difficult, unhealthy, and just wastes time and thought.\n\nClosed windows, air conditioning, and close beds spread disease. People are allowed to cough and spit all around, without being disciplined. Diseases included flu and Covid, both of which spread to every tenant. I experienced the worst and only flu in my life there. If you ever go, you should check for Hepatitis, as that goes unchecked.\n\nPrison lights from morning to night. You need a sleeping mask and sunglasses to protect your eyes from damage.\n\nAs far as I know, the caseworkers’ goal is to keep you there. Not housed. Not moving to another place or county. This is how they profit from you. Once a staff starts “writing-up” tenants for doing horrible or disrespectful things, the staff-member is in trouble, because they are losing the org money. So, they continue to keep the worst-behaving people, and continue the suffering of all tenants.\n\nNo one will help you find a house. No one will help you find a job. No one will help you escape. Unfortunately, it’s all up to you.\n\nI personally escaped to Berkeley, was placed in a shelter a thousand times better in the first day, felt much much better in two weeks, having a fridge ‘n pantry to store milk and eat cereal, having the spaciousness and peace of suburbs, found a job (at the uni!), bought a scooter (have safe parking!), and moved on with life. Never did I feel as good in those horrid SF shelters.\n\nThe job market in SF is terrible: unequal, the city culture has a facade of equality marketed by government. Each area has its own insular group of people. Nobody gets along. Much of the businesses are owned by and employ people from areas beyond SF. For example, most of the employees of this shelter do not live in SF. The same goes for the properties in the Tenderloin, and, likely, the rest of SF. So, being local to SF has no advantage, despite its focus on local neighborhoods. You are competing with the entire Bay Area, which wants the higher minimum wage of SF, benefits, etc.\n\nI recommend escaping this place. LA is a much much better place, especially for immigrants, Latinos, ‘n Asians. The Asians and Latinos here are struggling, living in SROs. SF is a cold cold place, inside and out. Food prices are insane. Landlords run the whole city. The Amtrak train goes all the way down to San Diego or up to Seattle(?). If not, maybe San Jose / Fremont would be a good bet.",

Especially if you have endured any sorts of abuse or bullying in your life. You will be sickly reminded of your past traumas by the staff and clients who overstay at this facility. Namely a woman named Claire and Yvonne will be sure to tell you what's allowed... And those are 2 of the long term clients that ruin the welcoming vibe...\n\nIf you do stay here don't end up trying to do what I did and ask the staff for their support because you will be sadly disappointed when they blankly stare at you when you express concerns that are legitimate in your eyes.\n\nThey may even act as though you are bothering them or inconveniencing them. The staff members won't tell you their name paranoid they will get written up. The staff that is crooked looks out for me other crooked staff members. There are only a few gems on the staff (Will, Patricia Turner thank you both) that will make sure you feel cared for and that you feel safe at the shelter.\n\nI only lasted barley 4 weeks here , then after being repetitively bullied by a specific client that had been staying at the shelter for years(Claire, Yvonne), and a few of her friends that were staying there as well, harassment from the staff members specifically, I won't mention names because there are too many to list.\n\nI had to have the San Francisco crisis team meet me at the shelter and help me to be able to leave to seek safe Haven elsewhere. This was just ridiculous to deal with and I hope that no one else will have to suffer being the new girl or guy, LGBTQ person etc.\n\nAt Episcopal community services sanctuary homeless shelter. Their name does not even come close to describe what it is actually like to call the facility a home.\n\nDon't leave any of your personal belongings out in plain sight or you will risk them being Stolen right from underneath your nose maybe even while you're sleeping in your bed. By other clients .\n\nThe staff members ruined it for me with their inability to show accountability for their own cruel ridgid bad attitudes especially when on the job. No client advocacy ..or encouraging group support meetings, meditation circles, nothing . Overnight staff can be found fast asleep at their desks.... sucking their thumbs.\n\nThe case workers are nice , I'll give them that .\n\nFood was only breakfast and dinner. .... quality was ok ... mostly I didn't eat the food . Lasagna night was good . And sometimes the pancakes were alright .\n\nIf you don't mind being bullied on all sides then maybe the place .... not for me though. I endured enough bullying and abuse on my own during this homeless chapter of my life and life in general\n\n.

There's nothing else I can say about the sanctuary accept that...\n\nBut if the lady that does my therapy is any kind\nof example of what type of person is under that building as far as counselors and therapists and so on and so forth then they are in great hands.

Nestled in the vibrant heart of downtown San Francisco, this place has been my sanctuary during my journey through homelessness.\n\nMy case manager, Dwayne Kershner has been nothing less than an angel; his guidance was pivotal in navigating me back to my dream job. His dedication and support have been truly unparalleled.\n\nThe pod monitors deserve a special mention for their quiet, respectful nature, ensuring peace in our shared spaces. The convenience of having an onsite laundry service staffed by the friendliest team you could imagine simply adds to the comfort of daily living here.\n\nThe food? Absolutely delicious! Every meal on a wheel feels like it's crafted with love, adding warmth to our community. The living environment is not just quiet and secure but has a serene, homely feel.\n\nA huge thank you goes to the security, janitorial, and maintenance teams. They work tirelessly to maintain an environment that is not only safe and clean but also feels like a place where hundreds can thrive.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend the Division Circle Navigation Center to anyone in need. It's more than a shelter; it's a community that rebuilds lives.",

This shelter provides 3 meals a day and most of the staff here are respectful and courteous to all the clients. They have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to violent behavior. This shelter is coed and no one under the age of 18 is allowed to stay here. It took me a little over a year to finally get housed and the length it took me is about the normal length of time for anyone that is seeking permanent housing.",
            "I will give them 2 stars because the place was pretty much clean but the monitor staff sits around all day with nothing to do but stare and do fake wellness checks (which are the worst) they can happen 3 or 4 times in 10 minutes. while looking at you seeing you move in wellness. Most staff seem to have no other duties but to watch people, talk on their phones, and follow guest around. The male staff bust open the women's bathroom doors without knocking or announcing \"male on the floor\". The program manager sucks he's always in his office. He is in a office right by the mens bathroom. You can see the men using the restrooms because the doors are always open. They make you wait in an area to get a number to wash like an assembly line. They have lifers that take up residency in the shelters that become friends with staff and they hoard items and bring in food. There seems to be some racial tones between the blacks and latino that work there. The latino staff speak to each other in Spanish so English speakers can't understand them. The facility was okay. But the staff make you question whether your at the country's border or in a transition safe space.",

That I do not like at all. And the food is terrible! And the worst part is is the case management. They don't even try to place you into housing, which is their soul purpose of being there! They are supposed to help people who have fallen in their lives, and help them back up. Now don't get me wrong, I appreciate that that place is there for homeless people, but if the homeless people that are there never get housed from the resources they offer, then what's the point?

Haven’t been for breakfast but only dinner. Bring your own napkins and utensils. The 54 bus stop is right in front. Strict security and entrance policies.

The food is hot and good with salad, veggies, some kind of main dish, bread, and your choice of juice and water. They have showers from 3-7pm and they are clean and smell like lysol and you can bring your kids. They also have laundry services here.

            "This review is specifically about the employment services at 259 Hyde. So far, my experience with them has been disheartening, to say the least. Out of the 3 appointments I've had with them they basically no-showed for two, so that's... Not great.\n\nI first showed up during drop in hours because I was told to do so by HSA, as I'm currently living in a hotel and working to get a job ASAP. Made an appointment to come back and do intake the next week.\n\nI get to my appointment right on time, only to find out that the guy working the front desk hadn't entered my appointment into the computer system, and they couldn't meet with me. I was frustrated, but fine, mistakes happen. They apologized and agreed to meet me the next day.\n\nI showed up to my intake with a copy of my resume, which she then proceeds to \"rewrite\" by feeding it into an AI resume writer and spits out a very generic version of what I already had. I'm personally not a fan of AI and wasn't thrilled, but again, I went for it. She helped me apply to a few jobs and set another appointment for the next week to check progress.\n\nIn the meantime, of course, I'm doing my due dilligence. Applying for jobs and going to hiring events, meeting with other counsellors. Whatever I can do to put myself out there.\n\nI get to my follow up today right on time as usual, and I'm immediately told my counselor is sick and not in. No apology or anything, just sort of what amounts to a shrug. I ask if there's someone else who can meet with me, and he asks me to come back at 11, which I can't do as I have another  appointment. When I tell him this, he looks at me like I grew another head. He asks me if I got any calls back from the jobs my counselor had claimed to apply to for on my behalf. I said no and he proceeded ask if I had  been checking my email, as if I was somehow responsible. I'm fairly certain those job applications were never sent in. He took my information and claimed he would call back layer, and I highly doubt I'll hear a peep at this point.\n\nLook, I understand you guys are offering a free service and that's wonderful, but this level of unprofessionalism and lack of respect for my time is just offensive. Just because I'm struggling doesn't mean my time isn't valuable. And when you're already going through the slog of trying to find a job, being treated like this is especially discouraging. I'm sure they've done great work for some, I don't want to discount that, but come on. I've now wasted hours of my time I could have been spending doing something productive, and they were annoyed with ME for being frustrated. An all around mess.",

            "From as much of a neutral perspective as possible and with the experience of everything from MSC South (by far, the worst in every way, BY FAR) to Harbor Lights (Salvation Army) (the best, in success post-residency, environment, safety, pros, no cons). And 6 or 7 others; nav. Centers, shelters, dual diagnosis programs. So I feel this is pretty accurate w/ all that to compare to; This Nav. Center isnt dangerous but everything else bad. No resources readily available, the staff is the worst part; 2 handfuls of thugs. Seems much like the boss's boss is an inexperienced, unprofessional troubled youth who hired all his friends. There is no one to reach out to. The staff actually harassed (legitimately, not just ur usual 'shelter drama') myself as well as others in unnecessary and rather awful ways, racial, bullying, and more. I truly am clueless as to how they continue to operate unscathed. On second thought, I'm not, it's as simple as no one having anyone to answer to because the higher ups are all corrupt themselves. Though, despite, I am appreciative to not be on the streets and you should know that my review is, again, not vengeful, vindictive or influenced by personal experience in any way. I took much time here to shed some light on the truth to help others find what ever it is theyr looking for. This place is in a safer area I feel but that's about all they have going. Oh, and you sacrifice your name for a number. My name was '18', staff (most) didn't even know my name. The best to ya....",

            "My family and I’ve been suffering from homelessness since 2019. However, we’ve been in SF HSH System since 2023. As my family of 6 + 1 on the way FINALLY reached the top of the list / queue for housing, Compass called us to refer us a to a building in DTSF. Over the phone my Case Manager Maxwell Lasler said we were referred to a 3 bedroom unit, then behind the scenes he referred my family of 6 + 1 to a 2 bedroom unit. When I was finally made aware of what had been done, I called Camilla Alvarado (Maxwell Supervisor) to rectify this mistake. There was no accountability for their lack of integrity and so called professional behavior. Instead I was lied to that the 2 bedroom fits up to 6 people when the max is 5.\n\nAll the opportunities to be housed entirely and in the right unit size for my family is now thrown out the window because Compass employees are comfortable of lying to families in need. Makes you assume that they’re immune to this type of behavior and do it for their own agenda.\n\nCompass is NOT for the people! They need to leave Coordinated Entry Program to Catholic Charities; Bayview & Mission Access Points. Too many families complain about Compass integrity and moral ethics. They in fact need to be investigated!\n\nNow, my family missed the opportunity to be housed correctly in the building that we were originally referred to. We are still homeless and awaiting in the queue once again!\n\nTo all FAMILIES DEALING WITH COMPASS, please monitor, record, and document ALL your interactions & transactions with Compass and its employees!",
            "IF I could give this no stars I would...Compass is not for the families...or the (no Hispanics)..I feel like they should be investigated because the director owns the homeless children's network......The same or similar programs she has been head of for 20 years ...",

            "This organization saves lives by advocating for best practices as evidenced by research. It’s a shame other folks in these reviews are so ignorant towards such an effort. San Francisco will always be a sanctuary city to the queers, the homeless, the undocumented  - the heart of SF culture and why so many pay millions to live here; which is exactly how this homeless issue has been so exacerbated. Thank you for your service and commitment.",
            "This 501(c) organization appears to be fraudulent. It seems like their executive director is primarily benefiting from what seems like a profit-driven approach within the homelessness sector.\nWhile there are numerous programs aimed at assisting low-income individuals in purchasing homes or affording rent, it's disheartening to see that this particular organization seems to be more focused on protecting their own interests rather than genuinely helping those in need.",
            "Very unresponsive staff and it seems like they are there to just collect paychecks.  Was initially a fan of their organization but they have been utterly inafective and just exist to get paid.  They need homeless people to exist to get more funding.. just there to waste money.",
            "They have been holding the city hostage they are making money the wrong way. It should be called encourage homeless Coalition.\nI would love to know where the president of this organization lives .I'm willing to bet it's not in the tenderloin.",
            "This 501(c) is a scam. I’ve lived in the SFBay since summer ‘14. Their executive director just gets rich on the Homelessness Industrial Complex. I’ve rented my whole life and am priced out of my hometown and my home city of SF. there are a zillion programs to help low income folx buy a house / make rent, but this organization is a sham, protecting NIMBY interests!"

Never give up.\nEverything at Hamilton Family Shelter is totally do-able! I was thankful for a place to sleep at night. I think it could use more cleaning, but a lot of that was due to clients as well. That is probably the biggest complaint I have.\nThe meals served were Healthy, not bad. The staff was nice enough.\nFront Desk could be a little more organized :):)\nAll in All It was a humbling experience.\nTo the families still there \"Remember a closed mouth don't get fed\" Go and voice yourself, go to all the outside meetings, and do for you and your families.\nWell that's it for now!

I now am humuliated at work every single day becuase me and my son ran out of money and we have all our stuff in our car. This man knew i had barriers and i had to go outside of hamiton familes to recieve help. He told me i do not qualify for low income housing like mayors housing and they simply ask do you have a housing voucher. He always tell me i do not make enough money to get a place. Now im way to ashamed to ask for anything. Im now being harassed at my job. Im the homeless lady with her kid. Hopefully this organization helps me with the rest of my barriers my child do not deserve this and i dont either. I mean it was to the point to where derek had me mentally ill where i felt i was no longer able to continue rasing my child. I went to more friends i knew so im couch surfing. I applied for stuff on my own and i apply with my own money. One day last week he calls and tells me my time with the program is over and he has to get approval to help me do anything else. But if i want to live in the tenderloin at 1030 post thats the only thing he can help with. That place has no vacancies. So i guess im not getting no help.

Helped prepare lunch here on a Saturday morning - the organization does a great job preparing fresh food for its members and diligently cleaning its facilities.  I also happened to be there during their April birthday celebration where they prepared cake to celebrate everyone who had a birthday in April.  It's clear the staff is passionate about their mission, and the members seemed very grateful for their services.",
            "I Give this place a one star the security here is a joke people have syringes with them yet they make you relinquish all weapons a syringe can be weapon and a very serious life altering weapon. The cleanliness of the entire facility is worth the health board stepping in and doing some swab test and find out how fast the place gets quarantined and/or shut down the bathrooms and showers are extremely disgusting and very health deteriorating I wouldn't and won't shower in them even if my life depended on it. The individuals that work here are not compassionate enough to work at a place such as this facility I am a highly anxious or anxiety ridden person and they have yelled at me and others here in the facility/homeless shelter. The ways of operation is as if your locked up in a jail the front side of the building they buzz you through an iron gated door we're you get checked by security then you goto the front desk and getting (booked)/processed you sit in a chair all day and wait for lunch and smoke breaks/(yard time ) then you sit in your chairs some more till your places in your housing unit and assigned a bed. Now there a very few staff that have really good intentions and that do have compassion majority of this establishment is like well JAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "**A Disheartening, Dehumanizing Encounter with Ashante at ECS**\n\nMy experience with Ashante, a social worker at ECS, was not only discouraging but downright disheartening—a shocking display of negativity from someone in a role meant to uplift and support. From the moment I walked into that meeting, her eyes were all over me, sizing me up like we were on the street. The judgment was palpable. I felt it immediately.\n\nShe began the meeting with saying, “We are going to be STUCK together for 2 years after today,” and repeatedly said “It’ll just be me and you from here on out” throughout the meeting. It wasn’t so much what she said. Her tone was like she was actively trying to warn me.\n\nWarn me about what?\n\nWhen she asked if I was working and I explained that I was a full-time student she scoffed. Her response? “Hopefully that works out.” Not “That’s great,” or “Keep at it,” or even the most basic acknowledgment of my effort. Just a dismissive “hopefully.” It was like she’d already written me off because I’m a full time student instead of an employee.\n\nBut it didn’t end there. After making me sign a stack of paperwork—papers I believed were steps toward getting help—she ended the meeting, and I left with the false hope that maybe something positive would come of it. Days later, I received a text informing me that they were passing me off to another organization. Her final words? “Hopefully everything goes well on your journey.” That word again—“hopefully”—dripping with passive-aggression, as if even the barest well-wishes were too much to offer.\n\nAshante’s coldness and dismissiveness added *months* to my journey to secure stable housing. For her, maybe I was just another file in a case load. But for me, her attitude made an already difficult time feel impossible. It was crushing to be treated this way, especially by someone who is clearly not immune to hardship herself. Not to be rude but she’s a big woman, the biggest I have ever seen outside of My 600 Pound Life and I figure life has not been kind to her. Maybe that’s why she’s passing off that attitude to another Black woman who is smaller than her. Perhaps my presence triggered negative feelings of self-hate or memories of being bullied. Whatever her reasoning is, it was petty and unnecessary to treat me in that manner and she needs to be held accountable and investigated for bias and prejudice against the homeless population.\n\nIf you’re seeking assistance from ECS, be cautious. If you feel any hint of negativity or judgment, don’t hesitate to advocate for yourself and ask for a different case worker. No one deserves to be belittled, dismissed, or treated like a burden, especially not when they’re at their lowest point. I sincerely hope ECS re-evaluates its training and ensures that staff members like Ashante actually care about the people they’re supposed to be helping. No one should have to endure the cold indifference I did.",

            "The only positive reviews on here are from people who work there.  Anyone reviewing who has tried to use this organization to get help reviews it very poorly.  I've been homeless for 15 years in San Francisco and I don't even understand what this organization is supposed to be doing for me.  I am 54 years old physically disabled on federal SSI disability at this point and totally miserable living in a vehicle. I am medically fragile and need a place to live however, I have watched these people house friends of mine who were literally dying - the latest one comes to mind my friend Shakeme who was dying of esophageal cancer and needed to be put in a hospice. Instead CATS placed him in the Baldwin Hotel directly from UCSF hospital with a stoma and a feeding tube and he only had some kind of nurse coming in maybe once a day for maybe a half an hour. He couldn't even walk without assistance.  He died 3 weeks later there.  This is the reality of what CATS accomplishes.  All those reviews here that say they do so much more it's all just hype.  People who work there hyping on themselves.  Don't believe the hype.",

Even before shelter in place began in SF, Community Forward began deep cleaning, giving staff PPE and began preparing for the worst. They have even been supplying other nonprofits that are facing shortages of PPE, a true testament to the organization's overall character.\n\nCommunity Forward has proven they are truly a nonprofit leader, even during the darkest of times.",

But homeless individuals do not get housed from life moves. I've never seen them do anything for anyone including myself.

Call and ask them, they do not provide housing for the homeless.",

She said this is the wrong Hotline we wouldn’t be able to help you with that. She didn’t even ask any questions to perhaps report to law-enforcement really strange.  Today is New Year’s Eve 2:21 PM (12/31/2024)",
            "Who ever is giving this place 5 stars is getting paid... STOP LYING.\n\nAs a first-generation immigrant woman and mother, I deeply understand the unique challenges women face in the United States, especially those related to domestic violence. With that in mind, I’d like to propose an idea that could significantly enhance the support available to survivors at La Casa de Las Madres and similar organizations.\n\nOften, the focus on therapy and mental health treatment frames women in a bad light. To adress domestic violence with primarily psychological support gives victims the idea that it is —“in your head.” While well-intentioned, this perspective overlooks the broader systemic and practical challenges survivors face and can unintentionally reinforce the idea that the victim is somehow at fault.\n\nFederal law, specifically the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), recognizes that domestic violence is not just an emotional issue but a crime that demands practical support, legal intervention, and empowerment. VAWA highlights the need for services that prioritize safety, legal advocacy, and tangible resources. By focusing primarily on emotional processing, providers inadvertently overlook critical areas such as legal assistance, housing support, and financial aid—resources that are crucial for helping survivors regain independence and safety.\n\nIn addition to emotional support, I believe the program could benefit from integrating more concrete, empowering actions for survivors. Here are a few specific suggestions I believe would be valuable:\n\n1. Legal Resources and Referrals:\nOffering legal search assistance, direct referrals to lawyers specializing in domestic violence cases, or providing legal aid services that help survivors navigate custody, restraining orders, and divorce proceedings. To this date La Casa has not been able to provide me with this.\n\n2. “Field Trips or Self-Care Activities:** Organizing wellness events like “field trips” to spas or natural hotsprings, yoga, mindfulness and meditation sessions, or providing self-care kits with tips and resources to promote mental and physical well-being.\n\n3. Community Organizing & Social Justice Engagement: Hosting workshops on community organizing, advocacy, and social justice, with a focus on women, families, and children. This could include initiatives centered around political education, transformative justice, and grassroots movements that empower survivors and their communities.\n\n4. Survivor-Led Platforms: Creating a platform where survivors can share their stories, offer services, or provide mentorship. Inviting special guests, such as social workers, financial planners, or successful survivor entrepreneurs, to speak and provide resources.\n\n5. Empowerment through Recovery, Entrepreneurship & Education: Providing connections to resources that help women get and stay safe, sober, start small businesses, return to school, access childcare, or find financial support for housing and basic needs.\n\n6. Referrals for Childcare and Home Support: Ensuring that women have access to practical support for their families, such as financial assistance, referrals to childcare providers, home cleaning services, or emergency funds that can support their journey to independence.\n\nThese efforts would help build a more holistic approach that empowers clients to take active steps toward recovery and independence. Survivors would not only be supported emotionally but would also gain tangible tools and opportunities to rebuild their lives.\n\nWith this in mind, I’d like to suggest that La Casa integrate services and collaborate with the local government and law enforcement. Valuable insights into the societal and legal context of domestic violence can be found.\n\nAccording to California Family Code § 6203, services for domestic violence victims must include not only emotional support but also legal, financial assistance, and access to safe housing options.",

They advertise they have a crisis support line but get an attitude and tell you you have to come in person to receive services, when that line is advertised as and supposed to be for emergency support, crisis support and counseling. Just the same old story of a non profit further traumatizing the community they are supposed to help. And yes I’m Latina. They don’t seem to want to provide the services.

But other than that the other staff members play favorites they don't supply the shelter guest with the proper things that they need they harbor most of the things that are donated and give the donated items to the guest that they like. I wouldn't recommend this place to any woman going through real trauma as I was going through real trauma and I was mistreated and bullied out of the facility when I truly needed to help I followed everyone to a tea I kept my room clean I cleaned like a mad woman and I still was bullied and put out of the facility for no reason at all",

She's a self righteous predator who justifies her behavior, and count's on people  in crisis's not to fight. She's under estimated me, I will continue to warn others and fight her for UME.

An entire week and half went by, so many people added during that time. I ask how does that mistake even happen? If I never would have gone to the second place we would have never known. When I advised them of this mistake they made, they were so rude to me. As if our situation wasn't already stressful a simple apology maybe looking at the date we came in and fixing it but no instead just rude. We were never given toiletries bags and snack bags. I didn't even know they gave that. Until I went to Bayview and they helped us. They were very kind there and listened to what our family was enduring. I think sometimes people forget when they have a home to go to, some us don't and if that kind of job doesn't interest them in helping everyone properly that comes through the doors seeking help then a job change is at hand.

            "Warning: when getting free food, always attempt to get vegetarian. Free meat is provided AS IS, without any warranty, neither express nor implied, not for any purpose, neither for fitness for merchantability nor for freedom from defects of workmanship.\n\nTo begin, it's overrun with homeless people who explode angrily, the building is condemned, we're an honor-shame culture, and the food is boring and mediocre and despite being mushy, it's hard to chew and digest. On all the preceding, it's a classic example of an enterprise in the post 2001 USA.\n\nWords define status, and Carlos' status is seriously that he is a ----, and he deserves an equally and simultaneously serious and irreverent assessment. Unless you're asking because you need to have something that even for here is particularly abusive or ----ty to happen, don't ask for Carlos. I know I could suffer real life consequences for this, but that can't deter me because ---- Carlos, he is a wimpy ---ed little piece of miles gloriosus ---- and because FML. The fellow clients also vary, some are just trying to repair their lives since COVID and the recession. Others are here because they are ----s; for example, some of the clients have attitudes like \"I'm sorry I hit [a fellow client on a previous occasion]... I know [that violence isn't the answer]. It's fun though,\" which certainly is not my attitude. One of them once had an improvised battleaxe, and put it down to challenge onlookers to a duel that would have been by fist-fighting if it had happened.\n\nThere is the matter of Carlos and fellow clients. He once ate with a fellow client I've always had trouble getting along with, which is just another complaint I have about Carlos. Since then that client has disappeared from the region, so fortunately I no longer have contact with the fellow client. I still have contact with Carlos, though.\n\nCarlos was using the phone outside with the gate open. It wasn't supposed to be open and he wasn't supposed to be there then, he was supposed to be inside working. I ignored his warning to not shut the gate and I shut it. He then told me \"Catch me on the street, [word only black people are supposed to use],\" and he told an onlooker to \"Call the police.\" As it happens, neither of us is black, and to my knowledge even with the one-drop rule neither of us is black. If either or both of us were black, that wouldn't stop him from using that word. None of that can deter me, since ---- Carlos and ---- decadent and declining / collapsed empire anyway, the only solution to these problems that I know of right now is firing Carlos, leaving California and time passing. I've tried complaining about Carlos and so far all my complaints have had no result.\n\nDon't expect great results with the TV programming. The best I've ever seen on that glowing rectangle is Dope: \"This Isn't Miami Vice\" and the scene in Red Notice where the characters were fighting each other with a Soviet missile and a stolen Mil helicopter. It was pretty good for the USA's TV, and neither the reality nor the fantasy were set in the USA. Other than that the TV programming here is only worse. Unless there's a group activity that doesn't involve the TV, leave for the library at 10 AM exactly.\n\nJust don't combine Ara and rodents.\n\nIf you're going to bribe someone to have something nice happen, try Ara ... she's not too good for it like Leonard nor too bad for it like Carlos. I think if there's a good employee there, it's Leonard, but oddly (and USA-ly since always having the good employee around when it's open is too good for the USA) the staff member there is usually Ara or Carlos. Be kind to the cats, dogs, and the mouse. Other than that, they are pretty good employees for a country in the Americas that isn't Brazil.\n\nAll told, this gets three stars, since like the USA itself, there are better places and worse places for me than this terrible and necessary place, and Chomsky's finding that \"the USA is based on conformity and mediocrity\" is a useful approximation for understanding DDH.",

They service youth 18 to 24 and serve excellent food. The staff is amazing and friendly and the facility is within walking distance of Jack London Square with multiple things to do like bowling or walking the pier !!  And if you’re feeling bold walk through the tunnel and go to target in Alameda !  It is so peaceful here I love it, they recently gave me $500 to move to Arizona and I’ve been here in Arizona thriving ever since I can’t thank  the covenant house enough if I could thank them 1 million times I would!!!!!! I 10 out of ten recommend this facility for 18 to 24 troubled youth",

It has excellent food made by hardworking cooks, the staff are genuinely caring and altruistic, with decent rooms along with resources to meet anyone's basic needs. People who are giving it such a low rating are generally those who cause unnecessary drama, and then are surprised when the staff react negatively. While there are occasional staff mishaps...they get solved, sometimes it takes a day or three, but it gets worked out. It's places like these that help solve the crisis we are facing mental health-wise and poverty-wise within the US, and literally saves lives. Thank you to the staff, along with anyone who has made a place like this a possibility. It's heavily appreciated, and I know you're often not thanked enough.",

This place is a nice place but they have girls and boys there which is a big problem. If a girl says something to one of the A ministration staff even if it’s true or an allegation they won’t ask you anything they will kick you out like they did me on April 16th 2019. I’m not the sexiest person but they have too many gay people working there they always taking female sides and even if you do have prove or a witness that means nothing it’s them or nothing basically. My situation was very upsetting and I’m still upset because now I’m homeless & have no place to go. They claim they are there to help yes but there are times where some staff come into work with attitudes like really then you have the kitchen staff with attitudes when you just ask for a cup when there’s no cups on the Counter. I been there for a year and they went through staff like water because people don’t wanna work with them because its very It’s unprofessional so how can you stop it only way is to get rid of the Director and all those Sexist staff in the covenant house of California."

Call your representative on the city council where you live and ask them not to renew their contract with them. That will get more results than you can expect from Operation \"Dignity\". To clarify, this review pertains to their contract work with Alameda county doing general homeless outreach in Oakland/Emeryville and not their outreach with veterans, which I fully support and have heard positive things about. My personal experience with them as a non-veteran has not been positive.",

And I'm a firm believer that we should help others learn to help themselves, rather than simply providing for them.  This company does just that!\n\nThey are a non-profit so all donations are tax deductible which is a plus.\n\nThey not only provide transitional housing for Veterans, but work hard to get them their benefits, medical help, drug/alcohol programs, job training and support with long term stability."

            "I have been staying here for about 7 months. It's nice and clean and very quiet and I mean very quiet. The only thing I don't like is the room is small and they don't have any sinks or bathrooms in the room so it can become a problem if you want to pour something down a drain or wet a rag and wipe off a table because you have to run to the bathroom to get water or to even ring the rag out. But like I said it's quiet & seems pretty safe. They have Wi-Fi also different routines women can sign up for if they want to do it like movie night or going for a walk things like that. They have a humongous kitchen and I heard that at one point they gave meals here. Now they do give you what they call breakfast. But it's usually coffee in couple packs of dried oatmeal impacts of sugar and you can make your own I forgot they do have hard boiled eggs in the lady is very nice that hand you the packs of sugars I will say that. Oh the other thing is you can NOT have visitors men or women. But if you have a dog or a cat and you have a doctor note saying you need one then they'll allow that.. far as for Abused women it's an absolutely safe place to be in and you would feel absolutely safe...  So the Original Mary Elizabeth would be happy on that part.. ☺",

Downside to being so close to St. Vincent's hospital is that it's a consistent source of noise pollution.",

If you do not have severe problems or do not lie, you will not be approved for anything. (What you are being assessed for or what you can be approved for is a mystery.) And that's it. No help beyond that.\n\nWhat they don't tell you is that you actually do have choices: rental assistance (first + last month / security deposit), and, most importantly that if you have CAAP/GA assistance, you get $700, and that can go toward rent for an SRO instead of funding a terrible trauma-inducing shelter.\n\nthe goal seems to be to misinform people so that people may suffer in horrendous shelters in order to let the shelters profit. in.sane.",

To get into the center be careful because crossing the street you have cars exiting the freeway and turning right onto 8th avenue going out of high-speed there are two iron gates that will allow you in depending on the time  they will allow you in you will fill out a questionnaire if you would like to stay at the facility during the day. You are given breakfast and lunch which is provided by volunteers but not made on premises. You may also use the two charging stations which is a strip of outlets and not for everybody you may shower there, use their toiletries and beauty styling products, you can have access to free lightly worn used  there is a large seating area kind of like a library / living room with upholstered comfy Captain's chairs and Cafe style tables set up a variety of books and puzzles to keep you busy this is a nonprofit organization. There are counselors on site yet they are shorthanded. It could be a very frustrating time when you have no home and you're totally dependent on the Goodwill of others.  The staff was kind. Suzanne agirl especially they went above and beyond their job description and you can see their beautiful heart. They split split us all up into night users and day users if you are in the night program that will last for 3 months where they give you a bed three meals a day services and case management as well as use of the day facility. Any female individual may use the de facility when they register with the packet application upon their first visit.. There are weekly meetings,, character building at motivational pow wows to boost up morale now they do offer case management  and are. extremely knowledgeable of all the resources needed to navigate your life towards a positive independent one remember rules responsibility and respect.\nSo now that there's a little description of the policy and way of the center there are amenities that I would like to bring to light because when you're homeless it's these little things that you need help with it's not always just needing a place to stay you need a place to live day users get the morning showers night users must my shower at night\nYou can use the laundry service just have to sign the clipboard and that is a bonus of your day user because at night if they forget to tell you or if you don't have a chore that day you're screwed\nTheir dining hall is comfortable and accommodating and there are a variety of meals I was there and we had pizza we had some pork meatballs with rice like a fried rice. One Church brought lasagna and some delicious cookies and chocolates. There is nachos one day Chile therething, and help yourself to free jewelry and good quality makeup. receive your mail thereThe three stars are given for accessibility in a time of need I found myself homeless for the first time in my life leaving a toxic relationship.

            "Many accusations of racist, bias, insecure,  unprofessional staff. I witnessed and experienced a lot of this. A crowded emergency shelter dorm, that had close to a dozen people sick for weeks. There was no health protocol until more than a month after a multitude of residents were sick. Beds were striped when people left but not disinfected. Often no soap in soap dispensers. Bed frames had caked on dirt on them. Disparities in who is helped, and the type of help given. Several people also had food poisoning. A resident was allowed to use a full size bed, to store her belongings. Dorm has cameras. A woman walked around in a tiny white towel, two different days while sweeping, and combing out her hair. An older female staff person made her go put clothes on. There are teenage boys in the dorm. Male staff do not announce that they are entering the dorm area. Several non Hispanic women, who were white, black, and multi raced alleged that they are surprised a certain Mexican female advocate was still allowed to work there, that allegedly she told a disabled person if she continues to complain about medical issues and her rights that she would be exited, that she told a family that a housing program was full, when it wasn't. This staff person hung up the phone on me, when I declined to have an additional useless meeting with her. A lot of times an agenda of shuffling people to various shelters was pushed, even if a better option was in progress. A worker kicked out a mother with three children over something trivial. The woman and her children slept on a nearby bus stop bench. Chores are mandatory or you could get written up. Three write ups and you could get kicked out. I did not have any write ups but The Rescue Mission refused to state that in writing, which could hinder my housing prospects. There was only one staff person in the Emergency Shelter who was fair and consistent with everyone, and always exuded God's love. Many staff did not speak to me, did not say hello, did not say thank you, did not say you're welcome, several were even rude. I rolled my eyes in frustration, but stayed formal in spite of their treatment. A proactive, healthy, trauma informed staff, would know that customer service and salutations are the responsibility of the staff and not the client. Late in the night, two younger staff made a crude remark. I caught one of them sleeping on the job twice. Multiple staff laughed and talked about clients. This behavior includes the Manager. I overheard her tell a staff person, she didn't want to tell me I had a week's extension. I had to inquire twice. They were going to let me exit without telling me. The people who stroked staff egos, got more help, and better treatment. Most staff stand by each other no matter what. Positives about the place are any staff that treat everyone with equal treatment, there is always some portion of edible food, free laundry and supplies, a place to sleep at night, a weekly clothing closet, some great volunteers, a wonderful man at the front desk who said, the place changed his life, and an amazingly kind, just, ray of hope and light, who is the Associate Director of the Mission Academy, Sara!",
            "Thank you for the opportunity to volunteer and serve. It has become obvious to me that you don't necessarily need me. However the opportunity to serve is saving my life just as much as it might help any of the people who are enrolled in the program. God bless you in the name of Jesus Christ.",
            "This was/is a tough review to write. My toughest. They SHOULD AND COULD be everything they purport to be, it's very VERY sad that they have a chance to help and so few staff and administration take it. They denied us opportunities for shelter because they viewed me as a problem. The fact that we aren't on the literal street is amira le thanks only to God\nThis \"faith based\" program lies and uses coercion as they see fit, to have people doing what they want.\nWe ended up sick multiple times because of the unsanitary habits with chores and the bathrooms and total lack of soap for hand washing for 3 days, or the lack of cleaning the showers for people, the lack of cleanliness in the common areas and etc. When we reported illnesses -- as THEY directed, they punished us for being called contagious by Doctors (as they demanded we consult) and needing an isolation room to stop spreading the illness. Other people they denied isolating and let the illness spread through the dorm and didn't care.\nThere ARE a few staff members that genuinely care about the people at the Mission but MOST of them don't. It saved us from the he literal street for about a month and a half and we sometimes got edible food and it encountered decent or even kind humans. It is what it is. Do the best you can. 🩵",

            "Here we are now close to 3 yrs at St. Teresa's. Unlike the namesake,there is no compassion here. Elevators are at non working status most of the time. This leaves tenants like myself since I use a wheelchair, housebound. Worse yet,the laundry facilities are not kept up and at same status as elevators. Most convenient elements at other apartment complexes are not the same status here. Pests are out of control here too. All that would make living here comfortable, is sadly missing here. I love the location of being convenient to the trolley and surrounding eateries are very good. Staff needs to be more compassionate and proactive of tenants common daily living status as to  elevators, laundry facilities, and pests issues. Most tenants came from indigent circumstances. Common apartment conveniences would be greatly appreciated. 😉",
            "I stayed in one of Father Joe's shelters for about a year. I got physically attacked by someone and when I defended myself, they suspended ME from the program, without even investigating what happened. They concluded that I was the aggressor, even as I yelled for the staff for help. These places are so toxic that most homeless people choose to live outside and sleep on the street to avoid them. Ask yourself how bad a situation must be for that to happen. You're not allowed to advocate for yourself in these places, or else you become a target. Some staff members were really kind, but many weren't. Case mangers discouraged me from seeking opportunities to better my situation. Some of the most hateful people towards the homeless work in these places. These aren't places of healing, and case management doesn't work when there's literally no programs to help the homeless.",
            "BE WARNED WHOSE COMING TO YOUR HOME\n!!!!!!!!Waited 2 months to donate some very nice furniture, and they refused to take anything because it was inside my house, literally got yelled at given the most disgusting excuses by this place. I actually feel uncomfortable that they know where I live and came inside my home. I have never dealt with a more unprofessional, rude, lazy, inappropriate \"CHARITY\" in my entire life. I can't believe i waited months for this company. I don't know what kind of people they are hiring and sending to your home but I WARN YOU don't do it. DONT DO IT!!!! This company is abusive and rude, and i waa just trying to donate good furniture. 3 months of waiting and same guy comes twice, refuses to pick stuff up. Yells at me and walks out. I have NEVER seen a worse charity company when your giving them stuff for free. I'm literally shaking and crying. Horrible!!!! And phone customer service is just as bad. Refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I'm old and disabled and I just needed some help, and tried to donate and do right thing.",

            "It looks like I'm not the only one who has had their expectations and opinions of the organization as a whole completely shattered by this particular office and it's staff.\n\nI was referred to PATH back in December via Cal-AIM and my case worker has no-call/no-showed on me several times. She also flat out lied to me about everything from how the Clarity system works to where we were in the application process. In a three-tiered system with a score of 8 in the VI-SPDAT, an individual will qualify for rapid rehousing. NOT permanent supportive housing. Nevertheless my caseworker Alicia told me that I was on the list for permanent supportive housing. Impossible. She also told me there is no need to check in to the clarity system, however as I had been in permanent supportive housing (through PATH in another county) in the past I know this to be false. You must check into the Clarity system regularly to keep your place in the queue.\n\nThat was my experience then, and how it works hasn't changed. When I took the VI-SPDAT in September my case worker with Family Health Centers urged me to check in on a regular basis. I haven't been checking in because I was working with PATH (or thought I was) and they told me there's no need to check in. That's wrong, both factually and ethically.\n\nYou can't even get a call back from these people. I had requested a new caseworker be assigned after requesting a change in housing navigators. I was contacted by a supervisor by the name of Jessica Fox, and she convinced me to stay because they would help me out. All I needed to do if I didn't yet have two months of pay stubs was negotiate a lease on my own. Try staying gainfully employed for two months when you're homeless. Sober.\n\nJessica Fox retaliated against me by \"exiting\" me from PATH for saying that path sucks and that they have done absolutely nothing to help me. I pointed out that Cal-AIM pays for everything, not PATH.\n\n3 months of lies, neglect, and the most phony intonation I have ever heard from anyone is all my caseworker had to offer. And I mean PHONY to the point of feeling very awkward and uncomfortable when we met. And not her regular demeanor which I had observed before it became clear she didn't know what she was doing.\n\nFor a whole month, we met to work on a HSP. In her defense there was an entire week of non-communication after she know called no showed on me the first time. I'm always reachable by phone and not so much as a courtesy call or text message to say hey, can we reschedule. I'm still not sure if the housing stability plan was ever completed?\n\nI told them that if I was a junkie committing crimes and not working or contributing to society in any way I would get housed right away. That may sound like an exaggeration but it is 100% true. Just look at their SRO or any of the PSH shanties scattered abou the city that PATH is responsible for filling.\n\nI have filed a grievance with Blue Shield and I have expressed my concerns with SD-AIM prior to this incident in a conference call that lasted about 40 minutes. I will update them on what happened this week and I encourage anyone who has had experiences like this to call their insurance and file grievances, including any and all information so that corrective action can be taken. Whether fraud or defalcation is the cause is unknown to me however I do know that in the industrial welfare complex there are a lot of fraudsters who skim money off the system. The more ignorant the people are whom they house, the less likely the public is to find out that something is horribly wrong.\n\nSomeone wrapped up in drug addiction who gets most of the funds intended for their move in costs, who finally has a place to get high is far less likely to notice something's not right. Sometimes tenants are misled into seeking deposit assistance from charitable organizations when the deposit has already been received. It's called double dipping.",
            "It's a shame that this organization isn't functioning as it has in the past. I've donated a significant amount of money in the past as I felt like good things were being done to really help the homeless. It seems like its just become something of a Father Joe's Village where the goal is to raise funds and then help only those that bring in revenue, don't ask any questions, and then selectively play favorites with resources and expenses account perks for the lucky clients. I'm not even sure what it takes to get through to anyone in order to get basic questions, concerns, or who oversees the serious complaints",
            "PATH is fine, so long as you are okay with having zero agency in your own life, and voice absolutely no complaints, and above all else: DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. These \"people\" will not tolerate questions of any sort. Especially questions like \"Why are you telling me to put false information in this paperwork?\" Or \"Why are you telling me to lie in this rental application?\" There are only two reasons to avoid answering a question. 1. You don't have the answer. 2. You're doing something you know is wrong, and don't want anyone to find out. I'm sure it's since been changed, but their \"motto\" used to be \"Do whatever it takes.\" Someone should take a very close look at the operations of this organization, and their friends at the Housing Commission.",
            "These are photos of where your CalAIM Medi-Cal money goes. It was supposed to furnish my apartment, but was rerouted to PATH along with the personal items that were ordered in my name.\nThanks to Kim Bojorquez and Sydnee Wesala, (and Tammy, the mystery recipient to whom all things go) for stealing my money and shattering my hope for getting off the street.\nI toughed it out for 2 years, not knowing that PATH was just reserving me another square of concrete.\nThis is going to the police.",
            "Same like Father Joe's Villages. The Housing Case Management is horrible in doing their jobs by not accomplishing any of their quotas, leaving a lot of clients without assistance, leaving the non-profit for other jobs, better pay, and / or benefits. Most notably, supervisors don't even help but only treat clients like delinquents and trash, like clients aren't important to them,  but only the money and job titles. No matter if a client is in a shelter or in a Low-income based apartment"

            "ECTLC is a magnificent place to dwell in. They have a very caring staff, a very understanding and patient staff. They have beautiful hearts 💖 best place ever 🙏 I’m truly blessed to be there with my 3 kids. They have provided us with comfortable beds, AC, 3 meals a day. My kids are happy to be able to enjoy the parks they have and be able to play with other happy children. There’s no roaches very clean. They help with resources, with clothing and much more. Anyone will\nBe truly blessed to stay at ECTLC 🏡",
            "ECTLC has brought my family back together.  My husband and my self have a blended  family with 10 kids. The staff has been a great help. When no other program would help ECTLC never turned their back on use. Services ECTLC offer has truly changed our life's. This program is doing the God's work.",
            "I was lucky enough to get a bed and this is a wonderful program that if there's availability they will take you right in. They offer you showers fresh meals three times a day and a prayer group and a bed to sleep in yet the bed is 22 to a room. I found with people coughing and hacking I ended up getting sick so I left. One thing I did not like was the girl in charge of the room was just a recovering addict with an attitude. She was in charge and seemed to take the role as if it gave her the right to judge so she can feel elevated. What does wonderful is if you have clothing if needed and personal supplies and pretty good meals three times a day. I feel if you are not addicted to drugs or alcohol, it may not be the best because after 30 days they want to send you to a farm not a real farm that would be amazing but a farm where they take away your phone and contact with the outside world or ability to go to school or ability to work and you're basically isolated for 3 months and tell you are put back into the program again and then you're able to clean it's a great start great program but if you just have fleeing or needing to restart your life over it's not a good program for you. It seems to be ideal for those who are at the hands of substance abuse of any kind or mental disorder.",
            "I can see it being a great place for a hard-core former drug user or going there for temporary shelter. From my experience I was there for a few days and they push you you go to this \"Ranch\" but never tell you what it's like. They take all your technology and force you to go 3 months with only talking to family or friends for 10 minutes a week. Seems more like punishment than help. From what I explained you can't even look for a job untill month 9 of a 1 year program. Seems like the goal is to get free labor for 9 months while you get nothing and absolutely no freedoms. It's literally one step above Prison.\n\nSo like I said it is a good place for maybe a felon coming out of prison or a user who can't even be around the city or they will relapse. On the other hand if you just need a few months of shelter to secure a job and get your life together they have no ambition of helping you unless you help them first. I was told they have to homework on the Bible which is cool, building structure but 9 months of fake Bible camp really doesn't help you in the real world if you are trying to get a home.\n\nOverall 1 star great for emergency shelter, terrible program. Their goal is to get you to the ranch and indoctrinate in their system. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a Cult, but it is pretty close in definition. I left personally after 3 days with a injured leg cause I'd try my chances on the street than deal with that mess for a year.",
            "Absolutely horrible place to be. It’s fine if you’re there for the emergency 28 day shelter but nothing more. I was supposed to get transitioning today and because I didn’t have the funds until Monday and I asked if it was legal for them to take half out ebt they told me I wasn’t allowed to now stay there. It is illegal and welfare fraud that they take any of you ebt. It is a full in cult. They force you to follow their religion (who knows what one it even is) they don’t care to actually help anyone. They just want to use the people there for money. It also claims to be a non profit organization but requires you to pay $500-$800 monthly to be there. The food served by them is usually rotten and under cooked. Sally my so called case manager did nothing to help. They even fired my old case manager and left me without one for weeks and failed to inform me of the money I’d have to pay right then and there if I wanted to be able to stay there. When I asked why I was now no longer allowed to stay there she ignored me. Telling me I just work here so I don’t know the rules… make it make sense. It’s a straight CULT!!! Please save your time and do not go here. They are also now under an investigation for fraud.."

            "This program helped me and my kids in the most difficult time of our lives. I was really scared to enter the facility from what I would see in the movies but when all family and friends could not help I was left with no choice. Once I got there the staff were so kind helping me with items and basic hygiene needs. I had 3kids with me  ages 12,10, and 3. They  loved the play ground and all the activities that were available to them. The rooms were safe and clean. The staff were beyond supportive and it just felt safe. The food was delicious. I highly recommend operation Hope to any mother, father or couple that is in need of shelter. Guadalupe was amazing to me and my kids with coming up with a plan to get out of the situation I was in. She was kind patient and soft spoken. She was gentle with her words when it came to things she thought was best even if I couldn’t see it at the time. I’m so grateful for a place like this.",
            "This is an extremely helpful beneficial respectful encouraging shelter that supports and influences you to get the life you deserve  and have always wanted. Staff and case managers are some of the most loving caring and supportive people I have ever met ! This is a high barrier shelter and they make it that way for very good reasons!! The way it works is you put in the work you make a lot of sacrifices and you dedicate your life to have a better life! My son and I loved it here and everyone including residents all loved my son. My advice to anyone that really truly wants a better life for themselves or for their children is to come in all the way BE PATIENT AND OF COURSE BE HUMBLE it doesn’t happen over night it takes time and if you really want something and want the help you have to do some things you don’t want to. It’s only temporary not for ever. I want to give a Huge shout out to OPERATION HOPE for helping me and accommodating my needs and always doing the very best for my son and I ! You all are the reason I have the life I wanted for many many years 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 GOD BLESS YOU ALL",

            "I had a helpful person over at Chula Vista housing authority who told me to try this place. He said sometimes they do have funding..but they help women in situations like yours they can provide other assistance or give other programs that can help. When I called I was transferred to the department and was pretty much told right off the bat that there is no funding. I asked if there was anything else or assistance and she pretty much didn’t want to help me and was trying to just get off the phone. She sounded really annoyed to even have to deal with me and offered absolutely nothing of value. Not even with a date of when there may possibly be funding or anything else. Soooo much for being a place for women and kids. You can at least be kind and redirect people who are displaced due to DV. Oh, but also she said it had to be recent DV. How sad. Being displaced because of DV can have lasting affects for more than 6 months and people don’t know all the programs. Some people leave one place and go from place to place for more than 6 months trying to see if they can do it on their own. “Community services” that turn people back onto the streets with absolutely no help and to tell them they don’t matter because their DV for help “expired”.",
            "I just want to share how well I was treated at South Bay Community Services. I'm a 54 year old visually impaired single male. My only income is my SSDI. The County doesn't help the disabled with housing like before. It's a 12yr wait regardless if you're disabled or not. I was sent  here for possible housing  assistance. To be honest I didn't expect any help  here. Especially, after reading some of the comments in here. To my surprise I was treated well. Better than well. From the receptionist to meeting and talking with the caseworker. They are going to help me and I left with a smile inside and out. I personally just want to say Thank you to those good hearted people who made my day today. ❤️💯👍😊 GOD BLESS YOU!!🙏❤️🙏",

            "Off bat, I have NO problems\nWith masks. So, If you need to wear a mask, bring one because they don’t give a duck about your needs. I waited almost 6 months for an appointment, and not ONE time did a single staff member tell me I was required to wear a mask. I would have brought my own, but I wasn’t informed. How am I supposed to know if no one tells me??? There wasn’t even a mask available to me to use. They offered children’s masks. WTH?  I didn’t even know this was a medical facility!",
            "Whoever said this place would help people lied. They will ask you a million questions, then afterwards they will say they don't have any funds to help you. I really believe this place doesn't help black people at all because I have called at least 10 times and was told we don't have any funds every time. I went with another lady to get a hotel voucher from this office because I had an earlier appointment then her. They didn't help me at all because they said they didn't have an funds, but my friend came back to my vehicle smiling because she got her voucher. Even she said they act friendly but won't help black people at this office. It was both of our first time coming in the place, we both had the exact same situation. This place is terrible and racist."

            "So far, I've used Uptown Community Service Center as my mailing address.  The staff is awesome, and there's restrooms on site. If you drive, parking can be slightly challenging, and you might have to park 2+ blocks away. I'm bummed that they're going to be moving locations on October 1, 2024, although it will be slightly quicker and easier to get to. They also have showers on site at this current location,  and you may even be able to score a few snacks to last a couple days or so.  Highly recommend checking this place out if you're in need.",

They have been thoughtful, loving and secure my most important mail that I need to receive. not only that but they deliver many other services to unfortunate ones in this community. Please feel free to use their services but please respect the love and help the volunteers bring to this beautiful church. Bless Them and all of you!",
            "While helping out a friend to navigate the \"system\" (LOL) we met with Amelia Broadnax who was extremely helpful, professional and friendly.  She helped my friend set up a place to get his mail, and explained the other services the Center offers.  We learned so much just talking to her.  For example: I didn't even know that a person is denied General Relief Assistance if they own a car.  What!?  That seems very unfair and ridiculous to me.  How are people who are trying to get their life back on track supposed to deal with the \"system\" if they have to travel to all these different agencies without reliable transportation?  Governor Newsom, you need to fix this!  Anywho.....thanks to Amelia who was truly helpful and took so much time with us to explain things.  She is truly a blessing to this agency."

            "I've had the misfortune of encountering several homeless services operations, but Interfaith stands out as one of the least professional. Unfortunately, the staff often displays a lack of empathy and understanding towards the homeless individuals they serve. I've witnessed them gossiping about clients and, even more disturbingly, engaging in behavior that could be perceived as gang stalking or humiliation.\n\nOne of the few redeeming qualities of Interfaith is the food they provide. The meals are decent and frequently available, which is a vital service for those in need.\n\nHowever, I've noticed a significant disconnect between the staff's availability and the actual assistance provided to the homeless. Despite having a large staff present during extended hours, the windows of opportunity for homeless individuals to receive meaningful help are extremely limited and brief. This mismatch between resources and service delivery is puzzling and frustrating.\n\nOverall, I hope that Interfaith will take steps to address the unacceptable behavior of their staff and work towards creating a more compassionate and supportive environment for the homeless community.",

You know what they DID... what they are there for! YOU have to be the one motivated to help yourself and take advantage of that help and live life! You always think your alone and your not, some have had it worse. We all get lost once in a while but if you want to knock on the DOOR of opportunity. This is the place. The mentors were outstanding. The staff worked together and with us, the programs were the most healing (some work and some may not for the individual). I am thankful everyday for this place that healed my heart to the fullest. Taught me above and beyond a lot, to stand up, to be proud of myself and that I could do it!! Thank you YWCA\nPlease donate it does help us move forward more then you will be able to see and know and you are thanked tremendously! Sincerely, a past temporary thankful resident",

They tell you to get a restraining order in order to protect them and not really concerned about your safety or your case they claim  to assit you with legal help and pay for an attorney for your case but if something come up such as attorney and client relationship, they will not help you pay for a lawyer they don't care. This is not a real domestic violence survivors support. I would look elsewhere for assistance for domestic violence survivors. This is the worst location for any assistance for domestic violence survivors.",

I've also been bitten by bedbugs here. They don't make anyone wash their clothes when they enter so anybody can bring anything in there. No mattress covers on the mattress. The blanket they gave me had a used bandaid stuck on it. The water smells like sewer water & there are nats in the bathroom. I've seen bugs coming out of their sink once. They did however exterminate the place, but that same night I saw more roaches than I've seen before. I do not recommend this shelter to anyone!!!!",

            "I was able to work a regular job and save money for several months' worth of rent during my brief two-month stay at Urban Street Angels before finding a place to rent. Peer support also transported us to (outings) every week beach  , movies , bowling , amusement parks on urban expense .. Case managers and peer support are really helpful, and they were always there for me. Urban  offer young people all the tools they need for success; however, should they fail to make an attempt to better themselves, they will remain in the same situation over which many youth complain about not getting further in life .. urban gives them the tools but some of the youth are to entitled , lazy and cry babies , then become upset when they see other youth moving to their own apartments , purchasing a vehicle or even receiving a award for their accomplishments .. I, along with a number of other youth , practice Islam. We are Sunni Muslims The cafeteria staff's accommodating nature in substituting pig (pork) with plant-based or beef meals was really appreciated. My only issue with Urban is that it isn't quite urban. The Allied Security overnight security guard JEFF declined to serve us breakfast each morning during Ramadan, when Muslims are required to fast (not eat or drink anything from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.). Urban notified the security on March 10 that this will take place until April 10 about this, and it will happen every morning. The cafeteria staff repeatedly told Jeff where our breakfast food is so that we may eat at 5 a.m. before the sun comes up. Jeff refused, and my friend and I had had arguments with jeff about it every day for a week . Since we couldn’t get our breakfast at 5am that forced us to eat food although the day even though we suppose have fasted from 6am-6pm then Jeff had the nerves to file a complaint and sent emails to urban about us because he didn’t do his job .. he didn’t respect our religion.. then he asked us one day did we have a bomb in our pockets my friend complained  and nothing was done We take our religion very seriously. And that truly breaks my heart  but that’s not urban fault that’s allied because they are a separate company I complained to allied several times\nBut besides the Jeff situation Urban is a good start for youth 18-24 to receive free education , trades and help with free and affordable housing to help them start their life in a wonderful way I appreciate every staff member that helped me while I was here thank you all I’m forever grateful",
            "I recently visited the building to donate a skateboard and discuss some future projects to help lift kids self esteem as they work towards independence. The staff was very friendly. The walls were filled with information and I could tell there were clear boundaries being set for program participants.\n\nIt would be great to see Urban Street Angels expand as I know there are many young people who are in need of their support.\n\nI will continue to develop my understanding of their organization's efforts and help spread the word, support their initiatives, and give a helping hand to those they serve.",

            "They kicked me out and I became homeless for several months earlier this year, just because I had told a biological girl that I didn't understand why she wanted to transition. She got upset and complained, and I was put out. Apparently hurting people's feelings is a greater offense than the people who openly vape inside the dorms. Besides this, I felt that everybody at Urban hated me - so I genuinely HATE Urban Street Angels and DON'T recommend them to ANYONE.",
            "I am a former resident of the Urban Street Angels organization I must say that I had a great experience. This is not to say everything were  “peaches and cream” —however, because I put myself in the position to be helped, the staff were greatly supportive. I appreciate everything that they did for me. They invested time in me for the betterment of my life. I will forever be thankful and grateful to have been apart of such an organization."

When you need them they won’t answer their phone. When when you are dealing with their manager, Isaac, they will still not be able to provide the information you need and they took bc you trusted them, and defend you as a victim. I, for the life of me can’t explain to you what they do other than make you feel bad about being the victim. I’m not sure even the workers there could explain what they do other than make the victim feel stressed and worse bc they can’t seem to answer the phone.

It's now Feb. 2025 and when I called to check on my tax form, the customer service rep tried to tell me the IRS is lying about the 30 days and they'll send my 1098-c whenever they get around to it.

She didn’t seem eager to help others but protect the corporate talking points.\nThey just want to come look at what they can make money off of at a huge margin and cherry pick “the good stuff”.\nThere are better donation orgs like Salvation Army, DAV, VVA that don’t look at how much execs get paid before they can help the less fortunate.",

Instead of staying down in the dirt I stayed standing to continue rising up. So here I am at the San Diego Rescue Mission in Oceanside CA. I rated give stars bc it's a beautiful facility with awesome smiling eager to help you build staff. I will start with Kat she has a beautiful heart ND cares how u feel, then there's Kay she's very direct full of resources and gives u homework to ensure you are doing the foot work to build up. I mean why not?? If your not working u have plenty of time, right? Then there's James very humble cares about your needs and wants to help. Michael making sure us ladies keep our area clean and will give u fix it tickets to organize, yes! I got one but not bc I'm sloppy it's I did not have a 2nd bin they thought I had. that's just to name a few. In regards to residents ok to be honest the majority are sane neat and clean then u have your Insane that are, well u can fill that part in but the staff will do there best to ensure hygiene is priority ( Thank God :-). Beds and linens are cleaned weekly, beds are comfortable and floors, Wells and other areas are clean. At times if staff has suspicions they will follow thru with you and the area u sleep at. I know owner statement is a 30days shelter, well some residents have been given extensions for a 90days. This is a temporary housing facility and it doesn't mean u will move from here into a home of your own before your times up. It is possible IF YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK!! IF NOT, well guess what?? Your back on the streets maybe in a tent... I know that will not be me!!! So this is my story, you best believe I'm sticking to it. Have a good day with Blessings your way"

I have known of the Director for many years - and he continues to work in making sure this organization stays focused.

What I am finding out alot if these programs that are in Riverside county,  San diego County mu help with food but no housing., or even hotel vouchers california programs should be helping not turning people away who need help especially housing or even have transition programs and not have them fill out application that doesn't give you any results.\nHow do I  know this because the last five months I have  trying to help a family member with finding resources and it's been even with a job you still can't afford any housing. California is bad helping 😕the homeless and mentally ill individuals..",

            "Picked up a shift here and I need to inform new CNA’s so they don’t end up embarrassed and feeling like garbage after their shift like I did. So today I booked an urgent shift that was supposed to be from 2pm to 2am. When I arrived from Los Angeles I was informed the scheduler made a mistake. I was informed of that mistake while washing the dishes that were already in the sink when I got to the facility. Afterwards I contacted the scheduler to confirm the shift times. I never received communication back and that was at 2:14pm. Later in my shift I was tasked to do laundry since this was my first time doing laundry in facility i stayed in the laundry room. No one told me load laundry and go back to the floor! The individuals in charge of tasking me were doing their charting. The shift itself is not hard. But getting yelled at and threatened to be sent home because you didn’t know what was going on isn’t something I want new CNA’s to experience. Later in the shift, at 11:25 I was surprised to see that on my Clipboard app my Green PM shift was no where on the app at all. So I just worked from 2pm-11:45 all unpaid. How would you feel if you trying to book extra shifts to pay rent and then this happens. And the reason why I believe it was intentional is because on the Clipboard app it does say “Leave Early” on my end so I could have and would have left and got paid for the hours preferred. But instead I have to go there tomorrow morning and figure out what shady mess is going on with Clipboard and this facility.\n\nEdit: After having to return to the facility I have found out that I was blocked by the Clipboard shift scheduler and put on the DNR list for that facility. I believe this is an abuse of power because I did everything I was asked to and even after the incident I did not display attitude or a reason to get put on DNR. I will be in contact with whoever can take care of this matter because I am a little offended by that.",

It was the first and only time in my life that I had experienced any phenomenon even remotely close to this. By the grace of God, I had secured placement with STEPS, however, that was not the greatest gift at that time, but the next day at STEPS, I had the privilege of meeting the one and only mentor that I have ever had, in 58 years.

I’m always told there’s no clothes and to go online to utilize their services , but online is not accurate and the phones and emails aren’t returned….. I’m sorry but they seem to not be doing what they claim. they act uncomfortable when answering simple question about how to utilize their services …. they only cater imo to single male one person homeless families and not in a meaningful way that would help them move on from being homeless in downtown Sacramento, they do not allow children inside, and they seem to turn away women in need. The services they say they have they just don’t… there seem to be no services for single women with children to truly utilize here or in Sacramento other than calworks EBT and wic",
            "I was here with my special needs son in 2020. We were not given any help and no matter how many list we got on for transitional housing we were always called back saying that we were denied due to my son's disability they told us that because of his condition and he hit other kids they could not give us housing. People who had children with autism or targeted, a lady was made to go outside and sleep in her car because her child was special needs was nocturnal which is common with a lot of children with special needs she was also threatened with CPS even though she had done absolutely nothing to her child. I was also threatened with CPS and that was another reason why I did not feel safe there apart from the neighborhood also being unsafe and all the shootings that were going on while I was there I felt very insane. Staff screened at us verbally abused me and my son. I also witnessed a lady that had twins and when she got to the shelter she had nothing this was during the pandemic so even though there was a places for people would come through domestic violence they couldn't get into those places because of the pandemic and the restrictions that it caused. This lady asked the staff if they could help her get diapers to which they responded that she would have to buy some. They also made us sign up for things like tablets but they were never given to us they were never delivered to us they were never basically given to us by the staff. I also witnessed staff receiving donations of clothing but not actually giving that clothing to the people that were at the homeless shelter I witness them loading it into the back of their cars and taking it with them. And I also witnessed the same exact thing with the towels and the blankets that were given for the homeless people they would take them home with them in the back of their cars put it in their trunk. We were highly discriminated against simply because we were light skinned, even though I am Hispanic I was discriminated against by these people who were African American. I had never experienced something like this and it was absolutely the most horrible experience I've ever had I left the homeless shelter and found a room to live in which I was very grateful for because that's why I had come to the homeless shelter to try to find housing and they were of no help whatsoever in fact they would tell the transitional housing places that my son was too difficult in that they should not take me and my son. I experienced a lot of racism simply because I was Hispanic and I was experiencing that from Caucasian social workers as well as African-American social workers. The experience was absolutely horrible eye opening and I don't wish it on anybody.",

When I pulled up I watched by the manager Steve closely he watched my every move, I never left my car and the person came downstairs to pick up somethings from me. After I left the tenant was written up and reprimanded for my 7 minute visit. Next Move should be there to assist their tenants and not harass them. They all come from different situations and circumstances, some out of their control. Perhaps the Directors, Board of Chairman’s and whoever else is in charge should come and talk to their tenants one on one to see what is really happening at Next Move. The mission is great but they are in need of some majors changes from staff to apartments to the entire area. ☹️"

The management of addressing the technique and told me to stop and listen to him about leaving phones overnight but you already know the rules and I had somewhere to go and I already discussed this with the staff there beforehand and this aggressively almost forced to listen to it again. I feel this place isn't safe for people to stay in if the management is going to attack the clients and demand them to listen to them even when they don't stay there. I'm afraid to go stay there because I'm afraid the management may do something to harm me they're very powerful and very unprofessional they do not know how to handle public property it should be trained in this field they have unexperienced people working there what they're doingI'm afraid to use facilities even use the bathroom be an afraid that I might get attacked cuz I'm not listen to someone who pretends that they're my parent I don't know who's doing these orders to these people to let them do that but they need to recheck their employees and reevaluate who they're hiring for this type of work this place and homelessness should be an ideal environment for people to get their stuff together not for people to be afraid of God and love me and this is what they get in return",

All 3 of them, nothing. thermostats set to however cold outside, inside temp gets colder instead of setting it the opposite to get warmer. main hall is 60 degrees! dayroom 66-69 degrees. Dorm 67, 68, 69 degrees until about 2:30pm it goes to 72-75. At night it creeps back into the 60s at about midnight. It's cold with alot of elderly here. At 6am dorm is 66-68 degrees.  It made it to 71 at 3:15pm the other day. Dayroom stays at 66, 67, all day! Staff makes excuses about who has the key who doesn't have it and how many maintenance men they told to change it. passing the blame. cold for 2 weeks now affecting my health.",

I was first in line and I met all other qualification requirements, but I was told that they couldn’t help me because their goal is to get your balance to zero. Since I owed more than what they are able to help with, they refused to help me at all. The guy I talked to was a complete jerk during the whole process.There was no compassion or concern shown by this guy whatsoever. He kept talking down to me and treating me like I was stupid, and he interrupted me multiple times as I was trying to explain my situation. He completely blew me off, and then proceeded to tell me that they couldn’t help me. He didn’t bother to provide any other resources or anything. It felt like he was frustrated because he had to help me. If you hate people that much maybe you should find another job. This place is a huge scam! They get government funding, but they turn people away more than they help. You are required to give them your personal information before they’ll even answer a question, and I’m sure they use your information to file fake claims in order to get more funding.

            "my son has a mental health disability, he ended up homeless after a medical facility he was in released him to them(mission) because they didn’t wanna find him an actual program he desperately needed to support his disability care (He has amazing medical insurance), all of a sudden out of the blue this mission turned him out on the street over a misunderstanding with another guy, he has no resources & no money & no way to get his meds or food and now can no longer get to therapy(where he was getting his meds too) because they were picking him up and transporting him to and from therapy from the mission. Nice way to help people, turn them on the street with a disability & no resources to survive & all the sudden with no notice. Great “Outreach”  Now he’s sleeping on a train platform where its not safe or warm! If I wasn’t homeless he’d be with me, he depended on them for his survival. If they really cared about people? Its not how they’d treat people with less then them.",
            "Without a doubt Sacramento is better off having this organization assist with it's overwhelming homeless problem, but much is left to be desired in the manner in which this organization provides its services to the most vulnerable segment, and the segment most desperately in need of compassionate help, in the Sacramento community. In contrast, Loaves  and Fishes is a mostly Catholic organized, funded and operated homeless community outreach organization.\n\nThe difference between the two organizations could not be more stark. L&F volunteers and staff are so much more obviously compassionate with a true desire to make a difference in the lives of these broken people, many of whom are not functional due to mental illness and unable to help themselves. A truly heartbreaking condition to see society turn their backs on.\n\nIf only society took a moment to consider the fact that many of these people whom they look down upon and try to ignore the plight of, already had to survive traumatic childhoods, mental, emotional and physical abuse and rejection. Many grew up in the foster care system with no  family support and having to live without emotional support and nurturing, not to mention the ever present sense of rejection and low self-esteem their circumstances resulted in.\n\nAs a follower of Jesus Christ, not affiliated with L&F but an independent ministry provider to the homeless, I point to the Salvation Army, Volunteers of America and L&F as legitimate homeless ministry alternative providers. As a Christian, I am personally embarrassed at the way UGMS, who holds itself out as a \"Gospel\" organization, runs and provides its services to the homeless. They certainly do not represent this protestant, non-denominational follower of Jesus Christ.",

            "I live to declare the goodness of the Lord JESUS and show His glory and power. I thank Him for Roseville Gathering Inn. The directors changed while I was there, and I will say this about the current director... She is truly a representation of Jesus. She is directed by him, and not of man. She serves both the believing and non believing with the same love you read about Him having in the Bible. I was a recipient of said love. I thank God for Lindsey. Cheyenne was my case worker, very trying job she had to fit an hour in. I'm long winded, and was suffering the loss of my sister. Only people who know me know what that truly meant to my life. I probably died with her though I'm still breathing. None the less God is good. I thank Him for her life. Cheyenne offered me direction, encouragement, and with that, hope. I thank God for her. Truly was 3 months behind in my car note, lost my place, and breaking down because my sister passed when she got me. I prayed to God before I got here. I said you have to hold me Jesus because I'm not going to make it without you. Then I ended up here. I still have my car and more. Love that lady. Farah, Carmen 💛, Chuck, Rob love love love these people. True servants. Ms. Kim ❤️, boy oh boy what can I say... Don't ever bring your child here to be scared straight like I did. He got so much love from the donation closet and the actual people in the shelter he didn't want to leave. Children at this shelter don't suffer in homelessness, and one would assume that is so. They are diligent, watchful, and protectors here staff and residents alike. The Gathering Inn fosters a strong community, and they accept EVERYBODY. Even people like me who was accepted nowhere, and they showed me LOVE and that pores over to my baby. That was HEALING. Thank you Jesus! Ms. Kim gave him some ridiculous toys PLURAL that couldn't fit in the back seat barely, and it was to my benefit because my mom and grandma were always distrusting of me. My mom entertained the thought of my son being with me overnight when I was here. After I left my mom opened up more and more because TGI helped so much my mama could see the difference. I am back with my family, and FULLY active in my son's life. Nikki was the first director when I came. This woman could do something only my sister could, understand me and talk to me in a way that cured my anxiety and brought me understanding in a SENTENCE. Usually people would have to wrestle with me or refuse me. She never had to. She had a way of knowing what was wrong that I couldn't articulate in my suffering and speak to that. Love her and I love this place. When a certain worker became hostile towards me along with certain residents, and actually harassed me with them, which NOBODY outside this one person ever did Lindsey didn't just take their side she listened to me covered protected and moved me. Some residents also covered and protected me too. These people that work here and this institution itself was the hands and feet of Christ in my life. A true answer to prayer. God is good. Thank you Jesus for TGI. You are good.",

There needs to be many more locations and better prepared and trained staff members who have been through the program and successfully got their lives back who are able to relate and empathize and inspire hope.",

My room faced the church nextdoor. I met women there i will never forget. Nice tv room in center. Nice backyard. We use to sneak up on roof with elevator and look at the stars⁰ lol and dream, talk about someday having a better life. They never knew how we got up there, never will. We use to talk about how the place was haunted, strange noises at l ad te night and haunted by all the women of days way past perhaps. Some names residents i remember was essie, lynn, lisa, gracie, nancy, a hispanic gal i used to hang out in her room with she was waiting for her guy get out of prison.  A couple older ladies that were real sweet i met there. I hope they all are ok with happy endings as many were alone with no family checking on them. That must been so hard on them being seniors. My college\nFriends  came by said wow this place is cool. Its all how you look at it and live it. I surrounded myself with friends and tried talk help residents. I still pray for them. Once my pet Guinea pigs got loose and made it downstairs to the staff meeting was going on and ran across the room. They called me down to retrieve them, i couldnt find them and well they grew really big. Oh. No lol.scaring everyone in kitchen at night. So those were the days......i really wish they had free self help programs and job readiness there cause the women were unmotivated and often sunk down in a spiral of stress, aloneness and no way to self improve.\nNo alcohol or drugs allowed back then. Hope its same now. And oh the crazy elevator use to get stuck sometimes. I took the back stairs lol i could write a book on my experiences there maybe will.",

Many women down on their luck, but also many getting their life together, too.  You can see it as a place of hope or a place of despair, it all depends on your perspective.  I chose to see it as a place of hope.  Like Denise, I could write a book about my YWCA experiences.  Maybe somebody should write a book about all of the YWCA's and  sell it to raise funds for a worthy cause.  Women's lives are always a worthy cause.  The \"Y\" is always there for women.",

There is little tolerance for shenanigans, foul language or agressive behavior - all good things for the staff and visitors.

The SMART program moves mountains for folks in need and works faster than you could hope for anywhere. They will stand with you through the entire lengthy process and do their best to keep you going while you wait for resources like SSI to engage.\n\nTry to be patient.

Stick with your appointments, mind your manners, do your best to keep your end of the bargain and the staff will stick with you.

            "It's sounds great and all but there is nothing empowering ... we are homeless prego and with special needs child ... sober not drug or bad record . And I couldn't get help...I met with the director and she told me about it she every kind hearted but she hasn't been around and also I did all the steps. It took a while to get a response why I didn't make it. When I have job experiences already but need some extra support since the system failed me and my son which lead me to being homeless... this program sounds great and all but at the end of the day someone like me and my son we are not a priority. You go through application process and mandatory orientation then a interview.  After that about two weeks hear from the receptionist you didnt make the cut.. then days later reasons why because they have 75 plus and they pick and choose and sign up for next session.  With no full on feed back nothing written . Please sign up for next session ... I am not sure how low you need to be to get help for some of us being this low in a failed system is not helpful.  I was hoping which I should never feel or be rejected to ger help for my son and unborn who is also in need. But that this place would advocate and empower as they said but it's not true ... my son and unborn child are homeless... but our lives don't matter... we are not a priority more like a burden... they don't provide any resources to help solo moms like myself who can maybe benefit from this given a chance ... some stuff that sound great that is helpful is only for those in the program ... so if you don't make the cut then your lefted back to being stuck again . Nothing empowering or supportive for some of us who really need it... low key discrimination for females who are pregnant because who is going to want to hire one anyway?",

The ladies at Chicks in Crisis really reassured me and made my little ones and I feel safe and comfortable during the whole process of visits. Inez made sure my daughters would be safe and how she would be present during the whole visit. She called me as soon as there was a guest present to ask if it was okay, updated me on the visit afterwards and even gave me diapers or toiletries for my girls and I. After the first couple visits, my girls would run to the door and greet her, excited for their visit with their other parent and to play with toys, run in the sprinklers, watch the chickens or pig, and play in the bounce house.\nGreat place, great staff and such a better environment for children to have interactive visits!",

She is demeaning, will try to strong arm you saying you owe her money and that you're \"contractually obligated\" to pay her even when you are not the one required to be on supervised visits, did not schedule the visit and never got confirmation the visit was ever scheduled by the other party. I got a sour taste in my mouth from the moment I spoke with her on the phone for the first time. She has no empathy for her client base, is in it for the business and to get paid unfortunately. The name of her non profit is very misleading and her actions/words do not support females/mothers going through a crisis situation.",

They don't dispense soap for the bathroom, and people don't wash their hands, nor kids. Plus roaches, plus mold, and some staff member is allergic to bleach, so we're not allowed to use it at certain times. No wonder so many people were sick for weeks on end. They stopped accepting donations. You're treated like an idiot or a child at times. They let people scream and curse at their children. The rules are enforced depending on who is working.

            "I absolutely love this place! Bennie is the best! For families with children still in diapers or pull-ups, It is a great resource of 100 per month. This past month chicken has been very plentiful. I find all of the staff to be very pleasant and if you are kind and just wait your turn good things come to those who wait! Anything that we are unable to use we pass along to our neighbors. Nothing goes to waste. Thank you, Salvation Army.",
            "I've been coming here since I'm with a Sacramento and I love it the staff are very helpful and they are very much helpful",
            "Christina at the front desk is absolutely awful to interact with even when you stay neutral and ask simple questions. They told me last month to call in a week for assistance then claimed to have ran out for the whole month when I did. They are giving me the same run around this month but with horrible attitude. I have not been unkind or unruly and even if I was, why take this job if you are going to talk to people like that?",
            "I didn’t have a chance to print the documents needed because SMUD didn’t send the proper document until the evening prior to my appointment and my ink cartridge dried out due to non usage. However; Ingrid was very accommodating. She did not refuse to assist me and only warned me to have documents required in hand. This was a blessing for me because I just started my new employment opportunity and was unable to pay the rising electric cost at this time. Thank you Miss Ingrid!!! You are amazing.\n\n🌸💗\n\nKarin J-",
            "Her name is Jennifer. Ben was not working. Jennifer, who I've talked to Ben about before, is constantly rude, on a power trip. Ben attempted in the past to try to compensate for her rude, completely inappropriate behavior, but time is up. You folks need to put Jennifer to pasture. The last time I was there, she was over the top. Now, we all know Ben gets a little grumpy when folks cross over the Stop Here sign parameters, but that's pretty much it. For a paid SUPERVISORY Salvation Army staff, Jennifer's derogatory demeanor, narcissist behavior, and inability to EVEN enter information quickly, or understand SIMPLE words is incomprehensible. I'm going to contact your Corporate office, as unlike the majority of the poor folks who are desperately in need, many of whom cannot even speak English-- NO ONE should have to endure this fanatic. I'm not any of those above and I do not play when it comes to mistreatment of those in need because Jennifer wants to disgustingly feel powerful."

            "The need to make sure these kids don’t “fall through the cracks” just because they don’t fit in to a standard box is huge.  Children’s receiving home of Sacramento is doing the good work to help these kids with support, love, and special care when they need it most.",
            "This place is a refuge for young people of all ages to receive the support and care they need to recover from trauma.  The loving and caring staff on beautiful 6 acre campus, is the quiet place that traumatized children need to get the peace and support to cope with their experiences and move on to have a fulfilling and productive life.",

            "This place let's these kids run around late at night, they don't enforce curfews and don't hold these kids accountable for their actions. The teens are constantly at the convenience store I work and constantly stealing and asking customers to buy them tobacco and alcohol, and verbally abusing and even swinging belts/keys at my coworkers. Someone should investigate the safety of this home."

            "A short while ago I was truly at the end of my rope, and I could not see any light at the end of the tunnel, or a way off the street.  Pretty much every organization I contacted turned out to be a shameless farce without any meaningful assistance to offer. Then I contacted Sacramento Covered, and they helped guide me through the steps of applying for assistance, and they also helped me to get into a shelter. Although getting into the shelter did take a little bit of time.  In particular I would like to thank Emily Garcia for the kindness she showed me, because without her help, I might not have made it.",
            "Tried to call them around 10am, they answered the phone call and immediately hung up. On the second attempt, I’ve waited for about 15 minutes on hold, and then I was sent to voicemail. Poor service.",
            "I would like to take this time to give recognition to Mr.Anderson. He's been extremely helpful and attentive to this homeless me & my son are going through. He's truly an answered prayer for me. I appreciate all his assistance and so thankful for him as well as Sacramento Covered.\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Came here during open enrollment, it's by appointment only, hoping I would be able to sign-up for a reduced price insurance for my son. Especially, since they told me over the phone there were many options available for working class families. I had already told them I was not eligible for any subsidized programs,   but they assured me that there were other options. I showed up early for my appointment, was seen right away, my insurance specialist (can't recall correct title) was very professional and kind. In the end i was not eligible for any discounts or programs. So basically I  just shopped for a health plan that would have cost me same if I had gone directly with the insurance company or shopped online. However, the specialist was very knowledgeable about all the plans and deductibles. She was able to help me understand what I was purchasing. The waiting area was nice and clean. The receptionist was very friendly  and welcoming.",
            "My navigator was awesome Wes is a good worker and he is advocated for me for a lot of things.however they never follow through with me and my disability case.I can't get ahold of anyone I've sent several messages I feel like I've been abandoned. And the only person that's ever really got anything done for me was Wes. And now I'm having trouble with my doctors offices I'm having to call adult protective services they can't hardly help me and my disability hearing is June 29th. If it wasn't for Wes I wouldn't have gotten that hearing but I'm worried to death because I have no one to go with me no one to represent me and I have mental problems and emotional problems and severe physical problems and feel abandoned I had to edit my post because I made one out of anger and I'm trying to rectify that. I think they're good people but I think the problem is they're overwhelmed with people that do not follow through with the work that they started you can't just go up there and expect them to do everything for you got to do your part too. So good luck to all of you"

Steve does a great job keeping me safe and protected and helping me with housing",

And a staff member who does apartment checks lied on the list, i just see a whole lot of people who are petty.
