            "I was at the Ventura county rescue mission last week on a Tuesday and Wednesday I spent the night I was treated horribly by staff on Wednesday night my last night there that would have been last week I believe I believe it was the 19th I spent the night there I got cussed out challenge to a fight by a by somebody that was spending the night there woke up in the morning because I was on my way to work because I got woken up at 5:38 in the morning I was on my way to work I grabbed the pastry I got met with hostility by one of the residents who said this the guests eat first you guys eat last I'm like well I'm on my way to work I was just grabbing something as I was talking to one of the residents one of the guys a black guy with dreads told me leave the premises for basically saying what was being done he told me leave the  premises or you're going to lose your bed that's when I decided to spend the night in the hotel before I came back to the Ventura county rescue mission this place needs to be investigated for sanitary reasons it needs to be investigated the staff for how they treat people and needs to be investigated because the utensils are not clean dirty with things and food still on them my name is Yusef Salaam. It is by far the worst program that I've ever been to and I do not recommend it to anybody like I said your program it's facility it's cleanliness it's not top-notch as the first review says that gave five stars that's false advertising the director of this establishment needs to get on top of his staff about their rudeness about how they interact with people because it is not godliness and I don't feel no godliness coming out of a christian-based facility that's supposed to help people but at the same time you keep people down you guys might have just well start saying you're a rescue mission and just keep God out of it. And stop blaspheming",
            "The Ventura County Rescue Mission is top notch. The staff\nis the best. They don't discriminate against the disabled like someone posted in the comments. The staff is very friendly and fair.",
            "I found myself homeless. I am in a wheelchair. It says this wheelchair accessible however they won\u2019t let people in wheelchair. Stay the night. I don\u2019t know if this is a violation of American with disabilities act. The reason they gave me was that they don\u2019t have any handles in the showers. It just seems if they\u2019re gonna say they wheelchair accessible on the website here they should be wheelchair accessible.",
            "It is by far the worst experience Of my life. My son was there. The staff is rude and cold and have a better than demeanor. They are not welcoming to any questions you may have and God forbid you question anything that goes on behind those walls. You will become their # 1 enemy if you so much as question anything they say. Rules apply when they want to whom they want and at their convenience. The staff is cold, and condescending. Quick to anger if you don\u2019t do what they ask even if it is not required of you to do so. They are not welcoming to any concerns residents families may have and absolutely hate when family members are involved. I have never in my life seen staff behave in such a way at any other recovery home. They leave residents to fend for themselves and only become interested in helping if it concerns anything monetary. They  make you feel like your needs are a chore. They are lazy. And there are many safety issues. My son went without medication for a week when that is one of their conditions if you are staying there and take medication. Refused to allow me to take him to refill it and was told I would have to wait a month to do so. When I mentioned it to another staff member they insisted that I take my son that very day to go get it. You ask a different person you get a different answer from each and every one of them there. My son was attacked and the persons that instigated suffered no consequences and staff didn\u2019t even bother questioning why my son had 2 black eyes. This is the absolute worst place to take a young adult teen that has never been in recovery before. The hallways often smell like marijuana and staff often turn a blind eye or they care very little about what goes on to even notice anything is going on. It is absolutely disturbing to hear that while my son was there  a resident was beaten so badly by other residents they had to stay at the hospital for a few nights. Luckily for rescue mission staff the victim was a transient and had no family that would be concerned about his well being. I do believe that there a couple staff members that indeed care about the residents but the majority of them are the exact opposite of what they claim to be. I regret sending my son there. I would insist that if anyone is looking for a caring supportive safe environment to send they\u2019re loved one to that they look elsewhere. You won\u2019t find any of that here.",
            "I was here shortly after 9/11/01. When they found out I enlisted they immediately put me out on the street. Chief was awesome and so was their wrecker driver(Scott? Red haired guy) at the car lot. Other than those guys it was what it was."

Gabriel\u2019s House not only provided us with a safe place to live but also gave me the support and resources I needed to find hope in my darkest moments.\n\nGabriel\u2019s House offers a safe space for women from all walks of life. The program requires discipline, hard work, and time, but it is incredibly rewarding. This experience has been life-changing for me, and I am deeply grateful for the support of the management team and the camaraderie among the other women in the program.\n\nThe faith-based structure of Gabriel\u2019s House has given me more than just hope\u2014it has strengthened my belief in God and helped me understand that everything happens for a reason.\n\nI also want to highlight their partnership with Food Share, a local food organization. Thanks to this collaboration, with a open mind I had access to high-quality food, which saved me hundreds of dollars and allowed me to focus on saving for my future. Gabriel\u2019s House is truly a structured program designed to set its participants up for long-term success, and I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to be a part of it.",

He was two. They wouldn't let him follow me to the kitchen so we constantly struggled. He screamed and threw fits often because of his condition but they were very judgemental about me and him. The case worker was often judging me and telling me how to live my life. Very rude and condescending when we were both going through such a difficult time. It resulted in someone calling cps for apparently no reason and me quickly running away to a family members house. Bed bugs on the bed that you can clearly see. I even pointed them out once and No one did anything. They bit my son everywhere and his poor face and body had bights all over. They will cook you food or give away food but it is old and expired and you may get sick. Also no phones after a certain time and bed time at a certain time. They were just so unsupportive too.  Oh and it's all a favorites game. If they don't like you youre ridiculed constantly. By the way I made it guys without ya!  still sober, living in a nice neighborhood on my own and out of Oxnard. My own business and new car and my son is thriving. Remember people never forget how you treated them! These people are not helpful in any way! Don't go here if you have kids especially kids with special needs. You can do it without this place holding you back!"

She could not answer so I ask what is your shelters mission she could not answer then I ask what service do you offer she wouldn\u2019t answer that question. how do you have a rude person working here and can\u2019t explain the mission or your shelter\u2019s policy.

            "If you are motivated self-sufficient, trying to find permanent housing, and just in need of a safe place to get on your feet. This is not the place for you. They bring you under the guise that it is a homeless shelter, they first tell you your paying for shelter fees and that they want a 3 month commitment $650 a month for single bed in a shared room then once you sign you are told you are paying for \u201c the program\u201d no one is paying the same amount almost like they charge what they want to charge that moment but in reality \u201cthe program \u201c is being enforced by other homeless residents who can be found in their spare time panhandling at the local grocery store. They are taken advantage of women in need and most of the positive reviews are the favored residents and friends of the director I have filed reports with dhcs/dfeh THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HOMELESS WHOM THEY KNOW HAVE VERY LITTLE OPTIONS IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TAKE THEM THIS \u201cprogram\u201d is a set up",
            "The place is infested with mice and roaches!!! The directors refuse to call pest control all they do is bomb and put down boric acid which obviously is NOT working. boric acid is extremely poisonous and there are a lot of young children living there which is concerning. It\u2019s $400 for you and $100 per child. Some residents were paying over $800 to live in filth with bugs and rodents. It\u2019s extremely sad. Me and my child were sick our entire time at love a child, we didn\u2019t get better until we left. I had to take my child to the emergency room because a roach was stuck in their ear and my child was admitted and had to be treated for an infection with antibiotic's. The director dismissed me from the program because I had to stay overnight in the hospital with my child but honestly I was relieved because I did not want to return! They threatened to throw all of my belongings away if I did not retrieve by the end of the day. They wrote me up for missing church although I provided them a doctor\u2019s note stating that me and my child were sick. I constantly got written up because the rules are unclear and certain rules only apply to certain residents. The staff are residents but they get away with things that other residents get written up for. They\u2019re allowed to let their children play outside unattended with no shoes or proper clothes on but if another resident does that they are written up. The staff residents will literally write you up for anything just because they can. This program is obviously taking advantage of vulnerable women with children. Staff residents are obvious drug users but directors do not care. They do not drug test you upon acceptance into the program so they basically let anyone in. They say that they do random drug tests but the residents I talked to on a daily basis while I was there said they had never been drug tested during their time there. One resident even bragged about leaving to go smoke Meth. They do not provide any housing resources! They do not do case management! All they do is take your money and give you a bunk bed in a filthy cottage ingested with roaches and mice. BEWARE",
            "I was fleeing domestic violence, my abuser is actively searching for me. I was dismissed from the program for being in the main office at 7pm.\n\nI was a late intake the day previously and had support with my domestic violence advocate. I was extremely tired and didn\u2019t catch all of the information. I figured I would find out more the next day. I went to sleep, left the property early on the morning- before 645a to get to work. The website says that they help with transportation to work, THEY DONT. It took me 3 hours to get to work via bus and BART for a 3 hour shift, and another 2-3 hours to get back. I was gone all day.\n\nI called the program prior to arriving, letting them know I was gone at work and making my way back. I arrived back to the property around 645p and entered the office.  I went in to ask questions about the program, how to fill out my schedule, and what I needed to do for classes, etc. I left quite early in the morning and knew I missed information so I was just asking for tips.\n\nI am not familiar with Pittsburg at all and wanted to know more about the are, how to get around, advice and things like that. As I was talking to the woman, we talked about God, my journey, etc. I felt so much better. All of a sudden a woman named Courtney whom I have never met before or seen before came in to say that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be in there. She spoke to the woman as if I were not there and said something along the lines of \u201cyou can\u2019t let these people in here just tell them no. I saw the camera.\u201d It was extremely rude and unwelcoming and I calmly explained that I was a new intake, and wanted to know more information and I took it upon myself to come in and ask what the requirements were, what I missed, classes.\n\nThe woman, Courtney said I needed to leave and could finish tomorrow. She then started speaking down to the new employee. This new employee is part of their work adjustment program and only made $10 for the WHOLE 8 hour shift. I calmly explained again to Courtney that this woman was just trying to help. I\u2019m fleeing domestic violence and I\u2019m in an unfamiliar area. Courtney said someone would call me and explain. I don\u2019t believe that because nobody called me that day, I actually called in twice, and nobody knew who I was.\n\nI explained to Courtney that I didn\u2019t appreciate her tone and asked how they would get ahold of me since they failed to do so\u2026 and she quickly glanced at my work schedule and was like \u201cwe can have an appointment with you on Tuesday at 130p. I said that\u2019s fine but I want my DV advocate there. As I\u2019m trying to pack up to leave, she says, that Love a Child has no gates and I\u2019m free to leave whenever I want. I explained that that was not what I wanted and I was grateful to be there.\n\nI told her I wasn\u2019t feeling comfortable talking to her, explained I had a social work background, and legal background. She asked what does it have to do with the conversation. I explained that she was escalating the situation, I have PTSD. She got visibly upset, and said I was being insubordinate and I was dismissed from the program. I asked her to please call my advocate and that any discussions and decisions need to be made by her as my PTSD symptoms were exacerbated by her.\n\nShe proceeded to cal police and told them I was there refusing to leave property. I said alright thank you, please call my advocate. They could not get in touch with my advocate.\n\nAs I was walking back to my unit (where I had only been there one night), she approached me saying I was free to pack my stuff. I was already going to grab my stuff, what was the point of her approaching me like that? To exacerbate my symptoms even MORE?\n\nApparently Courtney goes to Bay Church Concord, I also attend there. I\u2019m so disappointed in how she handled the situation. This is not how a Christian behaves. I slept on the street last night. Had nothing with me and it was 50 degrees last night.\nIsaiah 54:17 is what gets me through. But I am so sad and hurt by the lack of support especially female support.",
            "Tbh I had the worst experience i was in the hospital take to mind I was pregnant they called me the next day after I delivered my baby that if I didn\u2019t pay my program fees I would lose my bed I had no where else to go I had my 2 kids my oldest 8 my middle 6 and my newborn they had no sympathy for what I was going through. This program lacks compaction and respect for there residents and the office needs lots of work Shannon needs to get out the office and Courtney needs to open her eyes. I am thankful but living at love a child shouldn\u2019t b hard like they make it.",
            "I didn\u2019t get the chance to stay here. But I did go through the application process . This shelter charges $450 for a single person to stay in a bed with also a $50 intake fee. This is a lot for someone who has zero income. They said that they would help even if you could not pay . But for me there\u2019s too many requirements that made my decision about staying here. One requirement that surprised me is that If your dr has prescribed meds to you, you have to be on them to come into this program. Which was a no for me because I was in the process of changing drs & the medication she had me on induced diabetes so I had to stop taking them. If you want to be in this program you have to take all meds prescribed by your doctor no excuses. I would not recommend based off how much you have to pay just to be provided a bed."

            "No thank you so much for having me I'm going to further my enduring of being a nurse hope  I talk to you sooner",
            "Calli House is a great shelter. The staff there care for the individuals that reside at C.H. They have counseling  available, group/art therapy, meals and food, showering and offer bed space if available. I've noticed since being at Calli House, all staff push clients to look for jobs, go to school , help with health and housing situations but you must want to succeed and get better too. I'm grateful for this place. Definitely has forever changed my life for the better and taught me a lot.",
            "I've gotten to know Calli House well over the past many months and I see that it is a place that really tries to help all of the youth that some through it's doors. Every staff tries to be compassionate and kind, while encouraging youth towards their own set goals. It is a great place that deserves much praise.",
            "I lived at Calli House in 2012 and for me that was the best opportunity to move forward in my life. After a couple months of living there I joined the Job Corps program where I completed two trades and caught up in academics. Since joining Calli House and transitioning into the Job Corps program I am now a Job Corps graduate and a current student attending community college in pursuit of my AA Degree. I give praises to God for guiding me through this program. I think programs like Calli House give young adults and adolescence the opportunity to develop themselves and set solid goals. However, it ultimately starts with you and what you want for yourself. \u201cYou get in life what you have the courage to ask for.\u201d\u2015 Oprah Winfrey",
            "Calli house is a good place to lay your head if you are homeless as a youth as i stay here right now but it is bad thay tell you to get a job but dont give you the proper tools to help you out but u might have a better chance in prison"

You get your own room with a shower and fridge and microwave. On site laundry and on site staff and counselors to help with whatever you need.  On site medical and dental services also. You get one hot meal a day and snacks to get you through the rest of the day.  They also help you get food stamps and any other government assistance that may be needed.

            "I was so grateful to stay here! I got out of an abusive marriage and didn't have anywhere to go. It was during COVID when everything was crazy. You had to do what they asked (keep everything clean, get a job, get all the things you need to get welfare and housing) which was a breeze after what we went though. I only stayed a month, but the first night we were there they found out it was my daughter's birthday the day before and they threw a birthday party at the last minute. My daughter was so happy. They also added a snack in between breakfast and lunch because my kids and the other family that moved in would get hungry in between breakfast and lunch while we were there. They let us visit when my dad came from out of state as well. I also loved the room set up and the bedding. They had a TV and toys and books in the living room.  I stayed friends with some of the people I met there before moving to Coachella Valley and getting my own place in Palm Springs.",
            "If you are lazy or don't want to improve your situation, just don't come. This place is the only shelter in the county that let my family stay together. We have our own, private room. There's an individualized case plan for each intake and they truly care to help you leave here better than you came in. I love it here.",
            "This place is horrible that lady Cheryl treated me and my family horribly my son got food poisoning and couldn't eat for several days and she told me I couldn't make him anything different because it wasn't fair to the other families so my son went hungry for 2 days cause we weren't aloud to give him anything different. Also the local Walmart donates soaps and good for the families and Cheryl would pick and chose of what she wanted and would leave the things she didn't want for the families. I was told that I was living a lavish lifestyle I couldn't afford and was told I shouldn't have the car I had if I was homeless but let's not forget people don't chose to be homeless it just happens sometimes I was told if I didn't have to be there then why was I SMH it was a horrible stay but let me tell you ALEX she was amazing she's the sweetest most loving person in that entire shelter she helped me get thru alot of those hard days and stressful nights at that horrible place she made it easy to be there when she was working. This so called religion based place isn't so holy when you see the movement behind those closed doors they discriminate and make you feel like a low life good for nothing person... and it's like you can never catch a break in that place I would NEVER recommend this stay to anyone it was a nightmare. The only good thing that I got out of this place was the friendships I found with some of the families I met but other than that it's  true what one of the other comments said they will lie,decive and  do what they can to keep other people in and kick others out it's crazy if I ever were to hit hard times like that again I would definitely be better off staying in my car for sure but thank the good lord those extremely stressful nights and long days are past us now. If I could just put a zero star I would.",
            "Discriminating and deceiving they will talk behind your back, staff will start drama and you will get reprimanded and no apologies will ever be given. They lie to other ppl staying and tell you to lie about situations so some ppl can stay longer than others, they also use food stamps without permission some times and lie about amount",
            "A place to call home while waiting for your new one. They help you stay warm, find rest & learn structure. A good place that teaches you to value routine, discipline & learn to realign your priorities for a better future.

            "I was at the Ventura county rescue mission last week on a Tuesday and Wednesday I spent the night I was treated horribly by staff on Wednesday night my last night there that would have been last week I believe I believe it was the 19th I spent the night there I got cussed out challenge to a fight by a by somebody that was spending the night there woke up in the morning because I was on my way to work because I got woken up at 5:38 in the morning I was on my way to work I grabbed the pastry I got met with hostility by one of the residents who said this the guests eat first you guys eat last I'm like well I'm on my way to work I was just grabbing something as I was talking to one of the residents one of the guys a black guy with dreads told me leave the premises for basically saying what was being done he told me leave the  premises or you're going to lose your bed that's when I decided to spend the night in the hotel before I came back to the Ventura county rescue mission this place needs to be investigated for sanitary reasons it needs to be investigated the staff for how they treat people and needs to be investigated because the utensils are not clean dirty with things and food still on them my name is Yusef Salaam. It is by far the worst program that I've ever been to and I do not recommend it to anybody like I said your program it's facility it's cleanliness it's not top-notch as the first review says that gave five stars that's false advertising the director of this establishment needs to get on top of his staff about their rudeness about how they interact with people because it is not godliness and I don't feel no godliness coming out of a christian-based facility that's supposed to help people but at the same time you keep people down you guys might have just well start saying you're a rescue mission and just keep God out of it. And stop blaspheming",
            "The Ventura County Rescue Mission is top notch. The staff\nis the best. They don't discriminate against the disabled like someone posted in the comments. The staff is very friendly and fair.",
            "I found myself homeless. I am in a wheelchair. It says this wheelchair accessible however they won\u2019t let people in wheelchair. Stay the night. I don\u2019t know if this is a violation of American with disabilities act. The reason they gave me was that they don\u2019t have any handles in the showers. It just seems if they\u2019re gonna say they wheelchair accessible on the website here they should be wheelchair accessible.",
            "It is by far the worst experience Of my life. My son was there. The staff is rude and cold and have a better than demeanor. They are not welcoming to any questions you may have and God forbid you question anything that goes on behind those walls. You will become their # 1 enemy if you so much as question anything they say. Rules apply when they want to whom they want and at their convenience. The staff is cold, and condescending. Quick to anger if you don\u2019t do what they ask even if it is not required of you to do so. They are not welcoming to any concerns residents families may have and absolutely hate when family members are involved. I have never in my life seen staff behave in such a way at any other recovery home. They leave residents to fend for themselves and only become interested in helping if it concerns anything monetary. They  make you feel like your needs are a chore. They are lazy. And there are many safety issues. My son went without medication for a week when that is one of their conditions if you are staying there and take medication. Refused to allow me to take him to refill it and was told I would have to wait a month to do so. When I mentioned it to another staff member they insisted that I take my son that very day to go get it. You ask a different person you get a different answer from each and every one of them there. My son was attacked and the persons that instigated suffered no consequences and staff didn\u2019t even bother questioning why my son had 2 black eyes. This is the absolute worst place to take a young adult teen that has never been in recovery before. The hallways often smell like marijuana and staff often turn a blind eye or they care very little about what goes on to even notice anything is going on. It is absolutely disturbing to hear that while my son was there  a resident was beaten so badly by other residents they had to stay at the hospital for a few nights. Luckily for rescue mission staff the victim was a transient and had no family that would be concerned about his well being. I do believe that there a couple staff members that indeed care about the residents but the majority of them are the exact opposite of what they claim to be. I regret sending my son there. I would insist that if anyone is looking for a caring supportive safe environment to send they\u2019re loved one to that they look elsewhere. You won\u2019t find any of that here.",
            "I was here shortly after 9/11/01. When they found out I enlisted they immediately put me out on the street. Chief was awesome and so was their wrecker driver(Scott? Red haired guy) at the car lot. Other than those guys it was what it was."

They were courteous, and respectful and what I truly liked the most, is how much team work was a major factor. And everyone played a\npart in the upgrade to great weatherization\nappliances, and more. Community Action....a wonderful organization.\nThank you so much.",
            "This was my first time going to community action ever in my life and I just want to say that the lady in the front desk was very helpful, nice and very inviting, miss Patty was so much help and made everything as easy going as she could, she was absolutely amazing amd got me the help I needed so quick like lightning!!! So thank you everyone I won't be scared to go and ask for help when needed. Awesome ppl",
            "The help being offered is needed.  To get help, you have to complete 20+ pages, have a valid ID, social security card, bank statements, proof of income, and rental agreements along with any other information they require.  Communication from the workers can be frustrating, and the process can take months.  It's probably easier to just get a 2nd job and pay the bills..good luck"

            "I went through hopics twice for emergency housing and both times they were very helpful more the second time because they actually gave me transportation to get there .now they have relocated I was in need am in need of emergency housing again  .they said they weren't placing anyone idk if that's still the case I find it difficult going so early waiting so long just to not get helped but probably since they had just relocated .the hopics on Broadway still helps with emergency housing ?",
            "I can\u2019t even believe this is a program! Me and others that I\u2019ve spoken with has all had the same HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! They are only there for a paycheck! They give zero cares about people in need. I signed up to get help with keeping me in my place! I\u2019ve STILL!! Never heard back from my worker! Or her supervisor! It\u2019s been WELL! Over a month! I was given an appointment  to come back to bring two forms that they never told me I needed before hand! Only once I got there. However, I brought back the next week at the day and time I was given! Guess what! I sat there from 10:00 that morning until1pm!! ! Not my \u201cworker\u201d or anyone else  for that matter ever! Came out to see me. So I of course left!! Only for me to call back a few hours later to THEN!! Be told that she actually had NEVER!! Even came to work that day!! So I sat all that time for nothing!! Like  No one knew this?? Not even the front desk? Really!?!? Then when I was finally given her number, So  called, called several times,  leaving several messages! Was very polite and professional! Yet! She still has never called me back. Till this day!! Also the days I had come in looking and hoping for help! Person  after the person!  Would come in, go to the window and tell the same type of stories to the woman at the front desk! How they had been waiting for weeks to hear back about one thing or another! Or how their landlord has been waiting on something that was supposed to have been handled and how it\u2019s been over 3/4 weeks of calling and coming by with nothing! And these women at the window NEVER!!! Seems to know ANYTHING!! I watched this happen hour! After hour! Same stories. These people do not care about anything but getting a check! And as long as they have no one to check them!! Hold them Accountable!! They will continue to do the same thing which is nothing!!! And  get paid for it! It is the worst organization I\u2019ve ever walked into. It\u2019s the  people who are truly in need that is suffering because of it. Because if their supervisors continue being busy only being their friends instead of a true leader! Then they will never change this behavior. I still have never met my worker. I\u2019ve still never spoken to my worker! Only the \u201cintake worker\u201d. However, I\u2019ve left messages after messages after messages. No return phone calls,  no letters, just  no care at all for the Crisis in front of them. . I\u2019ve explained to her over the phone Just how pressing my situation is! And  Absolutely nothing.  I mean It must be nice to get a paycheck just to simply clock in!  And I\u2019m sure every one of them! In their interviews talked about how they love helping people.\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m sure they either started or ended with that LIE!!! HOPICS! Is not for the people!! It\u2019s where they all come and gather! Hang out with their coworkers! And get paid. I seen and heard SOOOOO! Much more then! But I honestly can\u2019t tell it all here. Only if someone of authority would call me!! I would LOVE!! To tell them everything I\u2019ve seen and heard! Even from others I know personally. HOPICS!! Is HORRIBLE!! And it\u2019s unfortunate. They don\u2019t even realize or care to that it\u2019s because of the people in need that they even have this program/job. They win though. We lose. The ones that has been helped! Trust it was ONLY!!! By the grace of God! Because these workers really don\u2019t care about you! \ud83d\udc94",

All 3 of them, nothing. thermostats set to however cold outside, inside temp gets colder instead of setting it the opposite to get warmer. main hall is 60 degrees! dayroom 66-69 degrees. Dorm 67, 68, 69 degrees until about 2:30pm it goes to 72-75. At night it creeps back into the 60s at about midnight. It's cold with alot of elderly here. At 6am dorm is 66-68 degrees.  It made it to 71 at 3:15pm the other day. Dayroom stays at 66, 67, all day!

They would rather keep you there than to help with what you're needing/asking help with : leaving Chico. Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

            "[posted erroneously to \"camping cabin\" last month, reposting to Pallet Shelter]\n\nThe gift of shelter is a blessing \ud83d\ude4f.  Without money, people spend 75% of their time  to get essentials, and the shelter provides food, water,  toilets, bathing, and laundry.  For the basics of survival, with  onsite access to health and other funded programs, gratitude is quite appropriate and very much appreciated.\n\nMy first night at the start of winter 2022 was particularly memorable: closing a lockable a door, having a warm meal, some new bedding, and turning on the heater with its own dial all meant a lot after 4 years of tent life. \"If I ever start to complain, please remind me of this moment\" held in stark contrast to prior living conditions.  That night slept on the floor as I was used to the hard earth, but I adjusted and had more time to focus on the available steps within reach to move forward.\n\nTo be able to transition to the next step in becoming a productive member of society again, and keep living with a lot less suffering, there are  onsite services for health, housing and employment programs that work to assist those with low or no income and varied backgrounds. All together in one place, these services and amenities provide more time to find what can actually help.\n\nTo those looking for help, keep trying. Talk to others and the volunteers, many elderly, some over 80 years old, who spend time just bringing goods to the homeless. Use the rebuttal / grievance form to ask about assessment and appeal.  The tiny home/pallet shelter concept is implemented around the country, and as a whole could be a good place to share a voice for understanding of the people in the homelessness \"crisis\" and the training of the intrepid few who work for the benefit of those without a residence and under dire circumstances just trying to live.\n\nRated 4/5 stars as IMHO there needs to be \u2022 more first aid,\n\u2022 better and more food, and\n\u2022 disaster training and drills for a living space of 177 units (200+ people and 90+ dogs) in a razor-wire, fenced-in community.\n\nSincerely,\nJay Tobias",

            "My partner and I came to this Shelter after leaving the Torres Shelter of our own free will and spending the first three weeks of August on the streets. She has fibromyalgia and I'm Epileptic, with a tendency, especially in the heat of summer, to have seizures fairly often.\n\nWe had hoped that coming here would be the saving grace we needed...except that, at least for me, that hasn't been the case. Yes I'm in a pallet with my fiancee. It's more like an 8'x8'x10' shed. Portapotties are graffitied with profanity and sexualized commentary, even the odd gang symbol...music blares at all hours of the day, dogs snap at you as you walk by, food portions are abysmal.\n\nBut the absolute WORST is the lack of caring by the staff that run this place. I am BEYOND deeply disappointed. My stress has gone through the roof, increasing my seizure frequency, as well as being unable to sleep due to barking dogs, blaring music from both residents AND staff at all hours of the night, and people arguing both inside and outside of their pallets. I've seen needles and nitrous canisters lying around and in the toilets as well as gang symbols and not a SINGLE thing is ever done. We have mentioned the loud music affecting our physical health to the staff probably about 50 times, mostly by one individual and they are still here doing it. The common answer we received is \"it's not 10pm yet!\", which is when quiet hours begin. Do I even need to get into the residents who leave the pets droppings all over the place...?\n\nThis place needs to start following and enforcing the rules that THEY THEMSELVES put in place! It's not really that difficult! It is an absolute trash town within a beautiful city and they are ruining my mental health. If anyone is reading this... PLEASE HELP US!",

I show up to drop off my friend and the women who working the early day shift were super rude and kicked us off the property. I tried to explain that we called the day before and the information we were told but the women working at that time kept cutting me off, saying, I don't care what anyone said to you, get off the property. I tried to explain that my friend isn't safe on the street because she is disabled and unable to defend herself or run away from any possible predators. The lady working told me that she didn't care, that check in time is only 3-5pm and to get off the property or she would call the cops.\n\nWe were not being loud. We drove into the property in a quiet little car, no music playing or anything. We called when we got there.

They don't dispense soap for the bathroom, and people don't wash their hands, nor kids. Plus roaches, plus mold, and some staff member is allergic to bleach, so we're not allowed to use it at certain times. No wonder so many people were sick for weeks on end. They stopped accepting donations. You're treated like an idiot or a child at times. They let people scream and curse at their children. The rules are enforced depending on who is working. My case manager Jessica lied to me about giving me an extension of two weeks. She told staff that I was still leaving as scheduled and it caught me off guard.

            "Wonderful clean place to stay. Staff is very professional.They offer free warm meals and also have activities. Kid friendly!!",
            "Really helped me and my kids I loved it one of the cleanest and best places to be that's the only place I would go if I ever need them Again    Thanks heaven",
            "Heaven of Peace is the Blessed Home felt  shelter that you could  ever be at.I never will forget this place because they treat you like family and they don't mind loving you as well. This shelter I will always thank God for and I will never forget a single  person who shared there Love to me Amen.",
            "While I was here I seen a lot of people get kicked out.  They would lose their points fast if they have kids.  Most of the staff I loved.  Some of the staff picked on people just to make them loose their points so they would be kicked out.  I also was told I couldn't receive any help with finding a place for my daughter and I because I didn't make enough money at the time I was in disability.  I was told that I had to get a job or more income.  I feel that they could work on actually helping people who need and deserve the help.  I wasn't released to go back to work by several doctors and to be told that I wouldn't be helped because I was to low income really made me lose hope.  What was worse is I watched a family member of staff who was on drugs and bragged about using drugs qualify for help thru the programs available. This person also bragged about being a family member and that's why she got her rent paid for and utilities for several months.  I feel that haven of peace would do much better actually trying to help people get back on their feet.  I do however realize what the staff had to deal with on a daily basis.  Very ungrateful,  selfish,  uneducated,  lazy,  individuals.  People who just use the system and refuse to even try to do their chores or respect the rules.  I'm very grateful for even being able to stay for the month we got to stay for.  Furthermore,  my daughter and I will not forget several of the staff their that were exceptional people!! That's why I gave a 4 star rating.  I hope you improve on the few things I've mentioned.  Thank you.",
            "If you are ever without a home please never come to this place it will leave you with even more problems than just a home! My mother came here with my sister and my niece and they had to go to the hospital for dehydration and kidney infection. The reason why they got dehydrated was because they only handed out 1 water bottle a day (the average human needs 8 per day) and the owners never let outside food or drinks (I understand because they don't want more problems other than they're rat infestation but my mother wanted to bring water in and they didn't allow her to) and when the owners were going to throw away water that someone had donated my mother and her friend were trying to keep it but the owners forced her to put it back. The kidney infections they got were from the filth of this place. The kids were so poorly managed they they would rub their fecal matter along the wall and that gave the kidney infections to my mother my sister and to their friend. The owners were too busy \"praying to their god\" that they did not address to abuse the children were going through. My mother tried to tell the owners that the children were getting struck daily for no reason just to get their mothers anger out but the owner turned her back and said she needs to go pray to god first. Since the mothers (there were 4 of them) heard my mother telling the owner about their abuse to their own children, they threatened my 55 year old mothers, my 13 year old sisters and my 5 year old nieces lives and my sister even suffered a panic attack twice and had to go to the hospital due to her not being able to breath. They were scared to go back but they had to. When they did one of the kids who was 7 walked up to my mother with a heart on a piece of paper and apologized for her mothers actions and she said she understands the pain my family went through and said that her mother hurts her too but she needs to care for her 1 year old sibling since her mother won't and it honestly broke all of our hearts to see that she was so young and understood that she was going through verbal and physical abuse daily and when her mother  seen she had any drawing or school work her mother forced her to throw it away and said that she doesn't like \"bullshit\" like that around her and the owner turned her back to this kind of abuse and when the little girl couldn't keep her 1 year old sibling quiet she got hit and even when another kid who was 3 weeks old couldn't stop crying its mother would punch the child to shut up and no justice was brought to these children they are still going through this abuse daily and no one is doing any thing about it. The 4 mothers would constantly attack my family by using verbal abuse to her and to my sister and niece. When my mother tried to leave with my sister and niece they threw her stuff into bags and left it outside but kept all of their clothes. 3 out of the 4 mothers got kicked out but the owners never told the police about the abuse of the children so they still have their kids somewhere and they're probably get hit right now as I'm writing this and it disgusts me that these people get to walk away with their kids even when their kids are getting constantly abused. I hope no one comes here anymore and please if you need a home find somewhere different than here this is the worst place you could ever go to!"

            "This place is so wrong. And they lied to us. They took somebody a young man that worked hard to detox and then come to their center to get help. They accused him of all kinds of stuff the first night and they said he had to sleep in the basement with the homeless And drug addicts down below. They never really talk to him to find out what really happened. They just accused him. They told me they were a Christian based place. This does not sound Christian to me. I went and got him the night they told To sleep in the basement. They degraded him. They treated him like an animal, and he did nothing. I.Brought him home and now they\u2019re saying they saw him on the street sleeping on the ground getting up and acting funny the next morning and they\u2019re going by hearsay. Let me tell you this. This is the worst place you could send your child. He\u2019s been cut down so bad that I am concerned and worried about him and I blame it all on this place. Thank you so much for lying to me and my family and giving us hope for him. he\u2019s trying so hard to do everything right he was so happy to be there and you say it\u2019s mandatory that he sleeps in the basement for two weeks. There\u2019s something definitely wrong with this program that you would send someone down there with homeless people drug addicts and it\u2019s freezing cold. I\u2019m sending all this information to my attorney that my husband and I have had for years and we will just see how far you get with what you Have done to my son. I\u2019m pretty reasonable person, but I\u2019m not now not with you lying like you did if I could, I would name every single one of you that did this to him but I Can\u2019t if I\u2019m going to start a lawsuit against you.",
            "This place seems to care and actually helps people",
            "I'm giving them a 3 because it's both Good and bad experiences. One of the counselors was always rude to me. A few drama filled people staying in the woman's part when I was there. Also not very much focused on Jesus and the gospel. As for the good, Good cooked meals clean and had a few caring and nice staff members.",
            "I love this place is definitely a safe haven! Spent a whole year here. Miracles do happen, if you are suffering from homelessness, addiction, abuse I highly recommend the Gospel Rescue! Your life will be changed! Amen",
            "I have never had a bad experience here. I am a caregiver who taken people to use this business for Payee service. I can say that out of all the Payee office's in Stockton this would be my first choice.\nSome people have stated they the area is no good or safe, but I have seen how the staff, handles emergency and stressful situations.\nThe volunteers are very courteous and polite, even the rude clients are treated fairly."

            "I was hired by The Gathering Inn management and was thoroughly impressed by the professionalism of Sheku, Lindsey, and Brandy. The hiring process was smooth, and the training, led by the new training director, was well-structured and comprehensive. It included Crisis Prevention certification and HMIS database system certification, ensuring I was well-prepared for my role.\n\nAll directors conducted their lectures with professionalism and provided valuable insights to equip me for on-site responsibilities. The team is friendly and welcoming, and lead case manager Sophia offers exceptional support.\n\nI was assigned to the North 5th Street site, which is exceptionally clean and well-organized under Sheku\u2019s management. I highly recommend The Gathering Inn to prospective employees, as the compensation is competitive, and the benefits are excellent from the start.",
            "I called and explained my situation and that my son and I are homeless and was told sorry nothing they can do and ended the call with have a great day. Like yeah everyday is freaking great being homeless with a child.",
            "I live to declare the goodness of the Lord JESUS and show His glory and power. I thank Him for Roseville Gathering Inn. The directors changed while I was there, and I will say this about the current director... She is truly a representation of Jesus. She is directed by him, and not of man. She serves both the believing and non believing with the same love you read about Him having in the Bible. I was a recipient of said love. I thank God for Lindsey. Cheyenne was my case worker, very trying job she had to fit an hour in. I'm long winded, and was suffering the loss of my sister. Only people who know me know what that truly meant to my life. I probably died with her though I'm still breathing. None the less God is good. I thank Him for her life. Cheyenne offered me direction, encouragement, and with that, hope. I thank God for her. Truly was 3 months behind in my car note, lost my place, and breaking down because my sister passed when she got me. I prayed to God before I got here. I said you have to hold me Jesus because I'm not going to make it without you. Then I ended up here. I still have my car and more. Love that lady. Farah, Carmen \ud83d\udc9b, Chuck, Rob love love love these people. True servants. Ms. Kim \u2764\ufe0f, boy oh boy what can I say... Don't ever bring your child here to be scared straight like I did. He got so much love from the donation closet and the actual people in the shelter he didn't want to leave. Children at this shelter don't suffer in homelessness, and one would assume that is so. They are diligent, watchful, and protectors here staff and residents alike. The Gathering Inn fosters a strong community, and they accept EVERYBODY. Even people like me who was accepted nowhere, and they showed me LOVE and that pores over to my baby. That was HEALING. Thank you Jesus! Ms. Kim gave him some ridiculous toys PLURAL that couldn't fit in the back seat barely, and it was to my benefit because my mom and grandma were always distrusting of me. My mom entertained the thought of my son being with me overnight when I was here. After I left my mom opened up more and more because TGI helped so much my mama could see the difference. I am back with my family, and FULLY active in my son's life. Nikki was the first director when I came. This woman could do something only my sister could, understand me and talk to me in a way that cured my anxiety and brought me understanding in a SENTENCE. Usually people would have to wrestle with me or refuse me. She never had to. She had a way of knowing what was wrong that I couldn't articulate in my suffering and speak to that. Love her and I love this place. When a certain worker became hostile towards me along with certain residents, and actually harassed me with them, which NOBODY outside this one person ever did Lindsey didn't just take their side she listened to me covered protected and moved me. Some residents also covered and protected me too. These people that work here and this institution itself was the hands and feet of Christ in my life. A true answer to prayer. God is good. Thank you Jesus for TGI. You are good.",
            "I would not be alive and well today if it wasn't for The Gathering Inn. This place is a godsend and frankly, not enough. There needs to be many more locations and better prepared and trained staff members who have been through the program and successfully got their lives back who are able to relate and empathize and inspire hope.",
            "Stppoed by to say hello..utilized their services a couple years ago. Unfortunately as I'm allergic to mold staying in mainly old churches wrecked havoc on my sinuses. Beyond that 10 out 10 would recommend as they really try to assist the homeless.  And they have a clothing closet so if you are interested in donating it goes directly to those in need free of charge."

I rode my scooter by here and guy asked me for 4 dollars I told him I dint have it so him and a Mexican with los Angeles tattoo and dodger tattoos jumped me yesterday . I don't even live here.. I just came back from the V.A and we are headed home to my house .  please be cautious if you walk pass this place it is dangerous.",
            "I experienced the most devastating events of my life at this place since the death of my sister at the beginning of last year, and I just wanted to come on here to proclaim the goodness of God. Nothing is perfect because we are on this Earth and dealing with imperfect people. I can see with all the imperfection diligent people who are the hands and feet of Jesus whether they recognize him by that name or not. I can see the fruits of the spirit in 90% of the people here whether believer or non believer. Even though because of the negligent, abusive, and predatory actions of one individual my husband could die, God doesn't cease to be good. Jesus is still Lord and Master, worthy of every praise. No matter the damage. I must still bless those who have cursed me, so I bless the woman employed here who cursed my family. Knowing a curse without a cause will not stand because that's what the word of God says. You can't curse what God has blessed. I also thank the people for the vision to erect places like this with the intentions of blessing their community. To Jesus be all the glory honor and praise. Please, pray for my husband's healing. He always seems to slip through the cracks, but no matter what happens, I will proclaim God's goodness all the louder. He can prevent the loss of life, but even if He doesn't He STILL is, WORTHY, and GOOD. I thank the staff that face the struggle of working with this population, feeling the heartbreak, and forging forward for good. Lindsey, Cheyenne, Farah, Carmen, Chuck, Coach, Rob....servants and an inspiration. They love and work hard for their community and they care care. Gabe, Nikki, Rose, Sarah, Hunter, Jenny, Meagan, Misty, Chris, Derrick \ud83d\udc9b, and Ms. Barbara. You all make the lives of so many people better, and I thank God for the experience I had that devastated me because through that I learned how valuable and important people like you all are to this community. Thank you for what you do and may God bless you in your endeavors and strengthen you to do His will. Oh! And Clyde \ud83d\ude0a. Love you all. I am so terribly heartbroken, but there will be joy in the morning. Thank you Jesus, for TGI!",

            "So I was at the shelter and was kicked out due to someone else\u2019s family harassing me . This included looking in my car while I wasn\u2019t there , which is on camera . They do absolutely nothing to help you . And people are getting high on fentanyl and they do nothing to them.also worker are suppose to be saved a dinner for when they get off work, but on many repeated occasions the pkate saved for workers are given to others already there who ate dinner and want more. So the people waiting for dinner have to wait till the next meal. I am one of a very few who works three jobs and still treated like a second class citizen.",
            "Went to the gathering inn and was treated like absolute garbage. They put me in a cot that was too small for my weight when there were bunks available and made me sleep on the floor for 3 day...so many bed bugs and the residents that live here do there best to try and get everyone else kicked out Feels like a prison then a place to get back on my feet service workers took over 2 weeks to even talk to me."

Remember that y\u2019all come here to clean bathroom, and we come here to study. Trash\n\nThe case black server denied service to people who needs help the most. Yeah everyone is racist right?",
            "A great place to get a fresh start. I was in the Turning Point program for a few months coming from the street. Though the help and encouragement we get was able to transition into my own independent living. Case managers are very knowledgeable and professional and will guide you to achieve your goals if you are determined.",
            "Only the few people that work there say that it's great it's a Jesus cult that judges you half Jesus half ghetto they look down on you as soon as you wait in there \"free line\" as they actually charge you money for basic homeless services they receive funding for to call them is even worse you'll be threatened by a guy  named Edward Lopez  he'll tell u that helping someone in need after a certain time using using order and without order there chaos?? literally my nickname \ud83e\udd23 but seriously this place is terrible and they don't help u or want to they just want your profile information so they can get paid 5 dollars a night that's 35 a week which is how much a month? U charge ppl u shouldn't charge and act like saints about it that's the truth like every other program Don't believe the hype even when your brand new in town they refuse u to stay if your not there at a specific time as if you'd know to be when your new and looking for help there paid and funded to help I ask u half thug half pastors where's the help practice more of what u preach I'm down with God and it don't cost me anything? Emmanuel house is better there strict but more friendly more professional loaves and fishes for food that's the best place there is been in town two weeks and city team is the worst place to go try it yourself but actually look at what's going on",
            "Don't waste your time trying to go here if you don't use drugs or alcohol. They don't help just for stability is what I was told which is unfair to those who don't have a drug habit and just need help transitioning back to society. Waste of my time \ud83d\udc4d",
            "City Team seems racist. I already talked to them on the phone several times for the phone screening, and they refused to do my intake for the housing program. I did their phone screening like two or three times, and they gave me the wrong address to the wrong housing program. The lady not only rejected me, but let me know in several ways that their housing programs are not affordable housing."

Yet they accepted recent prison releases and the homeless, as their description now reads. An alternative place to live was found for my brother and he was told repeatedly for 3 months or more that he would be moving.The staff did not follow through until recently. I can give names if someone cares. He was also supposed to be helped to furnish his apartment. Yet, he was left on his own in a wheelchair to do those things himself..My brother is a very intelligent man. He recognized all the inadequacies. The place was dirty.

            "I've been here for a few months now and mostly everyone has been very friendly and kind.\n\n( Edit I was kicked out for relationship issues with my partner while she was the one coming to me and holding me)\n\nThe only issue I've been having is there's no dedicated staff for services.\n\nBeing in and out the shelter daily they know my name and recognize me but not once have they asked me if I would like to get connected with services or need mental/physical health services.\n\nIt's okay, I mean it's very peaceful for the most part, and they do have 3 meals a day and potentially a snack as well.\n\nIt's been very appreciated and it's keeping me from being out in the weather with all my belongings. ( Update it was appreciated but they adon't really understand what 110 degree weather can do to people while sitting them outside in the sun all day)\n\nIf I could change one thing it would be people who are trying to work on themselves and leave should be able to stay in longer and have to go through a worker ( set appointments).\n\n( Update they did infact make that change but over all not strong enough to move people to want to seek there own life)\n\nThe idea is the people working to leave could use the PCs or even get resources that \"could\" help them.\n\nThe PC lab is very lackluster but looks nice... I walked in and had no clue what I needed to do to use the PC. ( Update it doesn't matter really there PC's are never fixed or looked at 3 hard drives have been ripped out the back of them and the best case scenario is to use your own devices and plug in via HDMI)",
            "I have a friend who lives there. The food is often a day close to their spoil date, or already spoiled, or some random things they threw together in a pot. I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food they offer to their Guests, it\u2019s disgusting. Most of it can\u2019t be named or really described. The beds aren\u2019t even supposed to be called beds. They are thin mats on Metal bunk bed frames. The mats are as thin as Gym mats. They get one small pillow and a thin blanket. They usually depend on donations to have food to eat. Today, in the morning, the shelter is out of milk, but it\u2019s a cereal day. They had one small cup of milk each for these tiny package cereals, like the ones they give you in hospitals. And the staff barely care and don\u2019t help the homeless people there get jobs. There is no recourses truly given to them. And this \u201cNew Start\u201d Program, for people who want to work but don\u2019t get paid. They also work AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER ITSELF. 8 hours everyday, one bus pass, a few privileges. That\u2019s it, they don\u2019t get paid anything. That\u2019s slavery almost. And 8 hours takes up the whole day and it\u2019s not consecutive, it\u2019s only when they are actively working. If you work in the Cafeteria, you have to be there all day. Serving, passing out snacks, prepping food. When will they ever use the bus pass? They have no off days in their work week either but don\u2019t get paid anything? This Shelter is using homeless people as well as not giving them opportunities for a better life. Don\u2019t go here. They don\u2019t care about you or your homeless friends or family or loved ones. People struggle.",
            "I have been \"living\" here for 3 months. Although I'm on the \"working persons program\" (since I recently became employed) they offer ABSOLUTELY NO HELP in terms of finding housing. There is absolutely no case management in terms of housing. I personally know of several people who have been there for years! I'm just in a rough patch and I need help. Although I need emergency help for a place to stay, I'm looking for help to have permanent residence and get back on my feet. They should offer a savings program and help you find a place to live. Also, the mattresses they provide are the same ones you would get if you were in Elmwood. Life is hard enough. I don't need to feel like i'm in jail. It just honestly feels like they're trying to keep as many people there as possible for as long as they can, so they can get paid for it. And certain staff members act like it's a burden to even talk to us. What's the point if ur not providing services to get the homeless housed?",
            "Humanity is special, and It's legacy.\nHelping others, and caring for people is so importantly for someone that needs it.\nThis place is very important, because it assistance with basic needs for US.\nThanks to all of you for your donations.",
            "This shelter works if you have no other options; you get a bed and bedding and linens are provided which is very helpful. They also have plenty of donations for if you need hygiene supplies or towels they even have some clothes donations which is helpful for people that come with nothing.  Aside from those benefits that I am grateful to have access to while I'm in this situation but the management and staff have no idea how to operate the facility smoothly.   My largest pet peeve about this shelter is how each staff member has their own rules that they like to enforce.  This is extremely unprofessional in my opinion they need to have a standardize list of rules and conduct that way when you go to ask a question there is one answer no matter who you are asking."

The staff is compassionate and truly cares about helping people turn their lives around. Highly recommend their work in the community! 5 stars!",

Will push to the limit to help you and find the resources.. now some security guards are not so nice... but some are.. I won't be unfair to the ones who are very kind and cool , Michael , Johnny, Mr. Anthony( black older man , not the other one with the man bun his rude as hell  ), Donte is nice Marquet is nice to name a few...",
            "People were smoking in the line and once they got in, I noticed at least one person continuing to smoke. He was at the table that is for assisting the homeless so I'm assuming he was one of the workers which makes it worse. A worker should know better than to smoke in a shelter. That shows a lack of care for the homeless because they are forced to breath the smoke if they want to sleep there.\n\nThey didn't provide any beds, or pillows or blankets or anything. We were told to sleep inside the gated area but outside the building in the cold. I was told that I could pick a spot on the concrete floor to sleep on. I expected a shelter to have beds and blankets so my only option was to sleep on the hard concrete floor in the cold. My back started to hurt so I decided that I was better off on my own.\n\nOne of the homeless said they sneak in weapons and that he has a weapon on him now. He also said that they will steal from each other. That tells me that the security to get inside is really poor. The homeless guy said he likes this shelter because they are less strict than other shelters. Personally I would prefer a shelter that was more strict like no smoking in the sleeping areas for example. I would never go back.",
            "Recent Feburary 2025 Review.\n\nFor Donors and Organizations I highly encourage you send one of your staff or yourself in the shoes of a normal everyday homeless person and see what's really going on with your money here, join the programs and stay for a week, and you'll see the issues I highlighted below.\n\nDon't fall for a \"Scheduled Tour\", show up unannounced and ask to see the property immediately or simply start walking around and checking it yourself.\n\nThe Owner or whoever is on the Top Level needs to start being personally involved much more often, because otherwise the only solution is Investigation and Exposure.\n\nThe Staff needs to be cleaned out Top to Bottom for the most part, while Ex-Residents have an idea of how it operates, they shouldn't be employed post-release, as this gives them a sense of ownership and favoritism that isn't in the Midnight Missions best interest of Solving Homelessness.\n\nThe end goal of a homeless shelter should be to close down once it accomplishes its goal.\n\nPhotos/videos of the street, lines, and eating times need to be published so people see the real issues. On the surface it appears to be a very good organization, but they would have better luck burning and tearing down the entire block and the ones around it. The pictures you see online is a place that simply does not exist in reality, it is vague clout chasing.\n\nThe Handling of California Government Assistance is also very sketchy as the staff wants to be abnormally involved in facilitating things like GR,CalFresh,MediCal, if investigated, it's possible you would find abuse of these funds and benefits for the lesser capable individuals.\n\nPortion Control, Food Quality, Food Preparedness, Food Safety, Could be heavily looked upon, Sometimes there is too little, sometimes they give you enough for five people. There's no sense of balance or rationing.\n\nI understand they need to serve a large amount of people who are at times not the best mannered, but if someone doesn't start running this place that actually knows how to be assertive they are just contributing to the problem /behavior and enabling it.\n\nIt'd be better to close this place down, restart it entirely, and open it up with better management. Whoever is running this place has no clue how homelessness actually works and how to fix it, they are simply keeping the problem in limbo.\n\nThis is a For-Profit Homeless Shelter, meaning they want to keep this Machine going as long as it brings income.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to spend a couple days, weeks, or whatever time is needed to come in with a different approach as people are -Reliant- on this Shelter and that will not push them to go try and make a change.",

            "Family shelter. Meals and rooms are provided, clean with parking and spectacular views of the City.",
            "It might as well be a minimum security prison, but your children can come with you. This has to be the worst place to go when you're trying to get back on your feet. They do not follow their own rules, they treat everyone like peasants, and their caseworkers will not help you. They say they will help with getting into contact with sources with Housing, Employment, and Mental Health, seeing as they have a contract with DMH (Department of Mental Health - Los Angeles). They charge the county for everything you do, down to a toilet paper roll, and yet they have no problem giving out free food to their employees from the residents cafeteria, which in-turn effects the residents. They restrict everything you would consider to be a normal function of life. In example: You cannot leave your children alone in ANY situation, including letting your child sit at a table quietly while the parents retrieve their meals. If there is a single parent situation, you must subject your child to second-hand smoke exposure in order for the parent to have a moment to themselves. I suppose they are encouraging quitting. A seasoned smoker would know that in stressful life situations, it makes quitting even harder. There is nothing for parents to do with their children in the center, but you can walk the streets of Downtown LA. There was a children's playroom, which is closed and removed all books and toys, and provides no opportunities for families to live a normal life. The staff is truly, terrible. It should be that in order for someone to retrieve a position like theirs, they should have to live the situation the residents get to experience everyday. The staff clearly doesn't care about their responsibilities or their assistance they offer during your orientation. Certain rules get more enforced over others.\n\nA harsh reminder about this particular organization, they discriminate. It is evident in how the staff reacts to certain people. There is favoritism among the staff and residents. They know about dangerous situations some of the children are living in continually.\n\nOne thing that I really wish would resonate, the fact that these residents are put here because they need help. Imagine if you will. Your family, for whatever reason, goes homeless. Upon starting your day at Zahn house, the breakfast announcement is around 6:45AM and runs till 8. If kids have to take a bus or train to school, most kids will miss breakfast. On your way home after work/school, you have to make it back at least before 5:30PM to make it in time for Dinner. If you're late, you only have till 6 to consume your \"healthy\" meal before the staff starts to close off the cafeteria. With that in mind. What would happen if you did miss dinner. You would have to wait till 8PM to use their vending machines during snack time. If you have no money, and no means of providing a dinner for your kids, its too bad in the eyes of Zahn. Your child now has to be punished just because their parent failed to return in time, god forbid there is traffic in DTLA at 5PM. You have to let your child starve all night. That's 6PM to 6:45AM of no food.\n\nDo you know what that does to a parent? To the point where you feel so hopeless, you wait till everyone is asleep to go into the bathroom and cry. Do you know what that does to a human being?\n\nEver consider what that kind of situation does to a mental health patient?\n\nThis place needs help. Real help. Not just \"caseworkers.\" J&J need to leave. - you know who you are.",
            "This place was so hard to be at emotionally!! It brings tears to my eyes!! Meaning hard to be at seeing my children there!!! However it was such a wonderful place for me and my family to be..when we had absolutely no where to go!!

            "I recently did a \u201cspring cleaning\u201d and had a lot of clothes in excellent condition (some with tags) that were too big on me and kids clothing that my children wore a few times and outgrew.  There were also some worn shoes, kids toys and books.  I called around and confirmed that this place is currently accepting used donations.  When we got there the lady took a glance at the box of shoes and said she couldn\u2019t accept anything because of the condition.  Admittedly the shoes were not super clean (since they\u2019re shoes) but the clothing was all washed and in excellent condition. She didn\u2019t bother looking thoroughly and rejected everything.  We spent a lot of time coordinating this effort and going to DTLA from Marina del Rey only.  It\u2019s incredibly frustrating since some of the people there would\u2019ve gotten a real wardrobe upgrade from the condition of clothing they had on.  We found another nearby shelter that happily accepted everything, so all was not lost,  but I wanted to share this unfortunate experience.",

            "I recently move here they said they will help me in some ways. It is like any scam institution as I'm reading people donate because Alexandria house tell the people they help people in need. The true is otherwise. Our family needed help to relocate and they can loan money to people in need, I contact them  but they did not reach out. Fortunate I am a working descent person I can manage to keep on going. If you ever need help keep praying and work hard do not wait around for any institution like this one they wont release the money people donate for the benefit of people in need. If you donate probably the help never reach to people in need. That is my experience.\nEdited\nThe response is mislead to make you believed they won't gives loans. They do, the person who grands them told me they do.( I do not wamt to give names away) Obviously by their response they do not delivered the help to the people in need. Also it is just a  loan without interest that the person who asked have to pay back anyways it is not like they give money away.\nThey knew my situation they promised to contact me on a certain date. The people are Israelites who collected donation and I guess they kept them to themselves\nWatch out who you support. That all I can say. The social help was not in anyway to help the people in need\nAgain is my experience all I want the people to know If needed  help keep praying and keep working hard there is someone out there that will help NOT this institution. If you donated please make sure you donate to institution that care for people in need. I had donated in the past thinking that one day I will need help and now that I'm in need I can see that NOT all the institution out there are for the benefit of the needy one. Fortunate I found this institution that open my eyes to see the truth\nTruth will set you free",

The vibe & atmosphere there feels very much like minimum security jail. Not the feeling one should have to experience when one is trying to move on and better their lives. A person named Tamara was the head when I was there; a very unfriendly and rude individual. I got the feeling that she does not like people of color, particularly black people. I understand we all have hard times & situations that may fall upon us, but I would definitely avoid this place like the plague if at all possible."

I was not familiar with people shooting drugs with port o potty water, or selling drugs out of port of potty\u2019s. But there\u2019s a first for everything. I am unsure of where Catholic Charities money is going. Because it certainly isn\u2019t helping those in need. It was brought to my attention on several occasions the staff is known for stealing the \u201cgood donations\u201d Pablo, Corina, Leslies, Cindy, Juanita, & Thalia . Are about the only staff members there who have empathy & genuine intent. Their rapid rehousing operation is a scam. Ask how I know. I got into it from Christina Atkins. Then thrown out 26 days later. They play dope fiend games. I don\u2019t know how this place is legal. Systematic oppression at its finest. You are a number. Not a human. And a dollar sign. THEE shadiest place I ever seen. A bike got stolen my first week. They will switch out bike tubings and steal parts to bikes. I didn\u2019t even know these kinds of petty thievery existed. Disregarding all the head banging from people nodding out on drugs in the bathroom. I forwarded a photo of the annex to a friend and was told \u201c I should go back to Mexico\u201d interesting what do you do if you are American citizen? There was a stabbing in the annex during my stay. They microwave raw meats. It\u2019s atrocious. They had to change the light colors in the bathrooms so people couldn\u2019t shoot dope anymore or see their veins. Merrika.",

I was so impressed with the staff and the beautiful space that they have created to help Sonoma County's Youth.\nThey have an overnight shelter and a day program which is open during the day to provide meals and a safe place to rest for Sonoma County youth. This is a great resource, especially for young people attending the Santa Rosa Junior College or nearby high schools.\nI asked about bringing other donations and they accept all kinds of donations! I brought food, but next time I'll stop by with backpacks, jackets, and things that teenagers would want.  :)\nIn addition to the day program, a home-like shelter is available for teens under the age of 18. Youth 18-26 (?) may go to the SAY Dream Center on the eastern outskirts of the city.\nI can't say enough good things about this.  Kudos to all the people who make this happen!",

The cost of rentals here in Santa Maria are sky-high now and almost impossible for one person to make it. The staff here will help you find a place to call home. If they can't they will send you in the right direction. They are also helping me with insurance. Basically, I think of this place to get your life in order so you don't find yourself homeless again. Everyone has their own room here so if the world gets to be too much you have a spot to  unwind and get right. The staff are great here. Some rules are crazy but I feel privileged to be a pioneer and help show staff which rules are great and which aren't. We are all different so it can make for an interesting day. The \"bossman\" Brian does take time to listen to us all. Heather takes care of the younger (over 18) ones and she's doing a excellent job!

I  mentioned to shelter staff, Yvonne, that I had an SD, and she said, \"That's a deal breaker.\" She said she'd talk with the director, and I should call in a couple of days. I called, and she denied us again after speaking with her coworker, Lisa. I reached out to Director Brian Halterman, who hung up on me 3 times, and also denied me because my SD is unaltered.\n\nIn the end, I am still homeless with my family of 6. They were of no help at all.\n\nUpdate: In October 2024, I filed a complaint with the Department of Justice. Brian Halterman has since been fired as the shelter director.",

They help with many things including nurse visits, housing options, a safe place to sleep, referrals for mental health. They provide 3 meals a day including second servings, they provide self-service laundry twice a week. Clothing if needed. Case management. All provided by friendly staff. I was really hesitant to come here but so very grateful. My life has been tremendously blessed by my choice to come here! 3 mos clean! #rainbowvillage",

I know how this place was before the Good Samaritan took over and in the beginning of the process. Everyone is right about what happened. However, I think and feel that the Good Samaritan has put a very good management team together. This place is taking a dramatic change for the better. Of course there are things needing more attention and some things should change. I've been here since July and have seen the meals for breakfast and dinner get a lot better. The manager is working on finding someone to help with lunches and a place that can help us get our laundry done. But since the past is the past and some people helped gave the bridge house a bad name. No one is willing to help! So if you read this I would like for you to think of change. \"I mean that's why Obama is a president now.\" Right? Please help spread the Good message that there is change here and ask yourself if your willing to change. Change the past to the now. Please help by finding churches with any help?",

The directors changed while I was there, and I will say this about the current director... She is truly a representation of Jesus. She is directed by him, and not of man. She serves both the believing and non believing with the same love you read about Him having in the Bible. I was a recipient of said love. I thank God for Lindsey. Cheyenne was my case worker, very trying job she had to fit an hour in. I'm long winded, and was suffering the loss of my sister. Only people who know me know what that truly meant to my life. I probably died with her though I'm still breathing. None the less God is good. I thank Him for her life. Cheyenne offered me direction, encouragement, and with that, hope. I thank God for her. Truly was 3 months behind in my car note, lost my place, and breaking down because my sister passed when she got me. I prayed to God before I got here. I said you have to hold me Jesus because I'm not going to make it without you. Then I ended up here. I still have my car and more. Love that lady. Farah, Carmen \ud83d\udc9b, Chuck, Rob love love love these people. True servants. Ms. Kim \u2764\ufe0f, boy oh boy what can I say... Don't ever bring your child here to be scared straight like I did. He got so much love from the donation closet and the actual people in the shelter he didn't want to leave. Children at this shelter don't suffer in homelessness, and one would assume that is so. They are diligent, watchful, and protectors here staff and residents alike. The Gathering Inn fosters a strong community, and they accept EVERYBODY. Even people like me who was accepted nowhere, and they showed me LOVE and that pores over to my baby. That was HEALING. Thank you Jesus! Ms. Kim gave him some ridiculous toys PLURAL that couldn't fit in the back seat barely, and it was to my benefit because my mom and grandma were always distrusting of me. My mom entertained the thought of my son being with me overnight when I was here. After I left my mom opened up more and more because TGI helped so much my mama could see the difference. I am back with my family, and FULLY active in my son's life. Nikki was the first director when I came. This woman could do something only my sister could, understand me and talk to me in a way that cured my anxiety and brought me understanding in a SENTENCE. Usually people would have to wrestle with me or refuse me. She never had to. She had a way of knowing what was wrong that I couldn't articulate in my suffering and speak to that. Love her and I love this place. When a certain worker became hostile towards me along with certain residents, and actually harassed me with them, which NOBODY outside this one person ever did Lindsey didn't just take their side she listened to me covered protected and moved me. Some residents also covered and protected me too. These people that work here and this institution itself was the hands and feet of Christ in my life. A true answer to prayer. God is good. Thank you Jesus for TGI. You are good.",

There needs to be many more locations and better prepared and trained staff members who have been through the program and successfully got their lives back who are able to relate and empathize and inspire hope.",
            "Stppoed by to say hello..utilized their services a couple years ago. Unfortunately as I'm allergic to mold staying in mainly old churches wrecked havoc on my sinuses. Beyond that 10 out 10 would recommend as they really try to assist the homeless.  And they have a clothing closet so if you are interested in donating it goes directly to those in need free of charge."

Last I heard it was 6pm but when I got there, everyone had already eaten dinner and there was none left.  So I think it's dinner at 5:30pm and worship / Bible at 6pm then ice cream after 7pm (after the sermon ends).\nSunday: out by 6:30am and wander Susanville until about 6:30pm; dinner most Sundays at about 7pm.\n\nCoffee Monday through Friday all day (except when they kick you out and lock the door)\n\nStaff:\nDaniel brings it all day.

They offer meal every once in awhile and a food bag if hungry, they have even given me diapers before because I literally didn't know what to do and had no way to diaper my child for a week and gave my 2 older kids a jacket when we first moved here because we didn't expect it to be as cold as it was. Thank you for helping the community when they need it!",

            "We were told we could stay there and look for a place to stay and there was no time limit. Within 2.5 weeks, we were told we could stay 30 days. When we asked how we are supposed to save up a minimum of 1500 dollars in thirty days to cover move in costs, we were told to get a rental agreement. We agreed. My wife is in the hospital, facing gallbladder surgery, and we called and told Susan, their director what was up, the only thing she gave a damn about was that stupid rental agreement, and not a tinkers damn about the fact my wife was facing a high risk operation. There really needs to be an inspector to go in and see their habits in food preparation, and how it's served. No gloves,T or hair nets. That troll that works in the kitchen, ( Terry), who is mean and always puts her nose where it does not belong needs to find another line of work. She has proven to be anything except a Christian. She sent my wife on a wild goose chase after ordering me to not park in their parking lot, and when I confronted her, she smirked. Never once was I ever so tempted to hit a woman! I truly believe this place should be either more closely monitored, or shut down."

I show up to drop off my friend and the women who working the early day shift were super rude and kicked us off the property. I tried to explain that we called the day before and the information we were told but the women working at that time kept cutting me off, saying, I don't care what anyone said to you, get off the property. I tried to explain that my friend isn't safe on the street because she is disabled and unable to defend herself or run away from any possible predators. The lady working told me that she didn't care, that check in time is only 3-5pm and to get off the property or she would call the cops.\n\nWe were not being loud. We drove into the property in a quiet little car, no music playing or anything. We called when we got there.

The fact that it is better than being outside they will definitely make sure you stay in a homeless state of mind. They dare you to feel free and safe or speak your mind. Perfect place for imates. If you have an inmates mentality this is the perfect place for you. I was kicked out because the staff refused to retrieve my food box and when I confronted her for her foulness I was kicked out into the rain and they kept all my food and refuse to place me in the que for housing after I spent a year there cleaning disgusting gnats that flew in my hair and mouth as I slept. The coordinators refuse to listen to us as a human because we\u2019re homeless (I\u2019m guessing) but I watched a woman strike another woman in the face for no reason but I get kicked out for knowing my rights.",

We stayed there for 4 months & they did not help us find any housing, then they stole our stuff on the way out. They have our $100 Vornado fan, a bunch of our kids clothes & containers, & my husband's family blanket. 1 staff member, Deb, uses drugs & hits on the male residents. She would not leave my husband alone, constantly coming to our door to bother us & ask him to do things & asking him to hug her.",

You'd think it was a punishment to be there, not a rescue type situation. The residents and staff collude to terrorize you. It's like jail is depicted in T.V. Only the toughest survive there."

            "Dear EOCP,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding the current living conditions in my assigned room. Over the past few days, I have been experiencing significant discomfort due to several issues that I believe require urgent attention.\n\nFirst, the cleanliness of the bathrooms is extremely poor, with the facilities in an unsanitary state. This is not only unpleasant but also a potential health hazard. Additionally, I have been placed in a room with roommates who have serious hygiene issues, which further exacerbates the situation. The room consistently has an overwhelming odor, and I have had to endure this environment daily, which has severely impacted my ability to rest and function.\n\nFurthermore, the room temperature is excessively high, resembling furnace-level heat. This has added to my discomfort, making the living situation intolerable. Last night, I was unable to sleep properly and was only able to fall asleep around 5:00 am after enduring the smell and the heat throughout the night.\n\nI kindly request to be moved to a dorm that is clean and free of these issues. I believe everyone deserves a living space that is sanitary and conducive to rest, and the current conditions are far from that standard.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution.\n\nSincerely,\nMike Masimalo\n(Who resides there)",
            "This place has potential to be a great place to get on your feet, unfortunately the staff has a problem dealing with different mind sets, it not a one case fits all, some are rude, disrespectful and at time down right nasty. There needs to be a change in the leadership.",
            "Place has no WiFi staff is ghetto and rude but hey it's Oakland what do you expect",
            "Worst place ever. Tacky place of business. They employees be high on drugs 24/7 and they hire nothing but felons with warrants.  They currently have someone working there that have an active warrant for his arrest behind a dangerous crime. When i told the lady in charge she brushed it off. She is putting the residents there in danger",
            "These folks do a GREAT service for veterans who are homeless or needing other kinds of assistance. My case manager has always been very kind and helpful, and EOCP has really been there for me when I needed help!\n\nMy only issues are:  The lobby is extremely noisy, lacks enough seating for people waiting to be seen, and always seems to have flies circling the middle of the room. The security gate at the entrance is imposing and unwelcoming. I would love to see a mural out there, or even a friendly sign that makes you feel more welcome.\n\nThe lobby does have an awesome mural to look at, and the people behind the desk are usually friendly - very busy, and probably overwhelmed with so many things to do, but I do like them. You just have to be patient in waiting for them to get to you at times. I only say this because I know some people have a hard time with patience, but the staff really are nice people. Just give them a chance.\n\nEvery caseworker I've ever spoken to has been very helpful in answering my questions or referring me to someone who can answer my questions. Again, I am sure their caseloads are pretty packed, so sometimes return calls and emails are a little slow, so again, patience is the key."

            "I was recently a temporary resident here I stayed for about a month and some change and I just want to say that this shelter is amazing. They service youth 18 to 24 and serve excellent food. The staff is amazing and friendly and the facility is within walking distance of Jack London Square with multiple things to do like bowling or walking the pier !!  And if you\u2019re feeling bold walk through the tunnel and go to target in Alameda !  It is so peaceful here I love it, they recently gave me $500 to move to Arizona and I\u2019ve been here in Arizona thriving ever since I can\u2019t thank  the covenant house enough if I could thank them 1 million times I would!!!!!! I 10 out of ten recommend this facility for 18 to 24 troubled youth",
            "I am a resident here. This is a lovely place. It has excellent food made by hardworking cooks, the staff are genuinely caring and altruistic, with decent rooms along with resources to meet anyone's basic needs. People who are giving it such a low rating are generally those who cause unnecessary drama, and then are surprised when the staff react negatively. While there are occasional staff mishaps...they get solved, sometimes it takes a day or three, but it gets worked out. It's places like these that help solve the crisis we are facing mental health-wise and poverty-wise within the US, and literally saves lives. Thank you to the staff, along with anyone who has made a place like this a possibility. It's heavily appreciated, and I know you're often not thanked enough.",
            "Hi my name is Jerome burns jr. I was kicked out due to an Alligation which was never confronted to me. This place is a nice place but they have girls and boys there which is a big problem. If a girl says something to one of the A ministration staff even if it\u2019s true or an allegation they won\u2019t ask you anything they will kick you out like they did me on April 16th 2019. I\u2019m not the sexiest person but they have too many gay people working there they always taking female sides and even if you do have prove or a witness that means nothing it\u2019s them or nothing basically. My situation was very upsetting and I\u2019m still upset because now I\u2019m homeless & have no place to go. They claim they are there to help yes but there are times where some staff come into work with attitudes like really then you have the kitchen staff with attitudes when you just ask for a cup when there\u2019s no cups on the Counter. I been there for a year and they went through staff like water because people don\u2019t wanna work with them because its very It\u2019s unprofessional so how can you stop it only way is to get rid of the Director and all those Sexist staff in the covenant house of California.",
            "To be real honest Covenant House is the worst place to go to.. manipulative child traffickers and it ain't green.. To my expertise one of the many reason we still have homelessness is Covenant House there believe system through the system is corruption it's self comforting people to believe in God and destroying the very dream there house system stands for... I have witness more scenarios of children getting kicked out then housed.. destroying every childs dream through mismanagement. No real follow ups. Wasting youths lives for profit.\n\n\"I was housed by covenant house.. I thought I had a glorious future.. soon I started noticing them trying to change my daily habits, in my own light and perseverance fully knowing my Immigration status and issues. holding back resources for profit. Feeding on other youth through rituals of using the holy dove.\n\nCovenant house might have a few success story in it's own reverent through prospering youths but keep it real that witch craft gotta go.. and I do put my name on it...\n\n- Ame De",

            "Not a good shelter, they don't help with transportation to reunite you with loved ones if you ever get stranded in Chico, California. They would rather keep you there than to help with what you're needing/asking help with : leaving Chico. Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",
            "This place is a blessing! This was my first time being homeless I was scared I didn\u2019t know what to do. They were so kind to me, took me in And comforted me through such a hard time. The staff are wonderful and have supported me the week. I have been here. I got an apartment so I will be leaving tomorrow so blessed that this place is here in our community to help out people who are in need. Big shout out to the staff! Chaz you were amazing thank you so much for being so kind and such a sweetheart! Chrissy, you were amazing Thank you so much for our beautiful Conversations\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ms.  May thank you for showing me and teaching me about boundaries. I love each and every single one of you guys. Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

            "[posted erroneously to \"camping cabin\" last month, reposting to Pallet Shelter]\n\nThe gift of shelter is a blessing \ud83d\ude4f.  Without money, people spend 75% of their time  to get essentials, and the shelter provides food, water,  toilets, bathing, and laundry.  For the basics of survival, with  onsite access to health and other funded programs, gratitude is quite appropriate and very much appreciated.\n\nMy first night at the start of winter 2022 was particularly memorable: closing a lockable a door, having a warm meal, some new bedding, and turning on the heater with its own dial all meant a lot after 4 years of tent life. \"If I ever start to complain, please remind me of this moment\" held in stark contrast to prior living conditions.  That night slept on the floor as I was used to the hard earth, but I adjusted and had more time to focus on the available steps within reach to move forward.\n\nTo be able to transition to the next step in becoming a productive member of society again, and keep living with a lot less suffering, there are  onsite services for health, housing and employment programs that work to assist those with low or no income and varied backgrounds. All together in one place, these services and amenities provide more time to find what can actually help.\n\nTo those looking for help, keep trying. Talk to others and the volunteers, many elderly, some over 80 years old, who spend time just bringing goods to the homeless. Use the rebuttal / grievance form to ask about assessment and appeal.  The tiny home/pallet shelter concept is implemented around the country, and as a whole could be a good place to share a voice for understanding of the people in the homelessness \"crisis\" and the training of the intrepid few who work for the benefit of those without a residence and under dire circumstances just trying to live.\n\nRated 4/5 stars as IMHO there needs to be \u2022 more first aid,\n\u2022 better and more food, and\n\u2022 disaster training and drills for a living space of 177 units (200+ people and 90+ dogs) in a razor-wire, fenced-in community.\n\nSincerely,\nJay Tobias",

            "My partner and I came to this Shelter after leaving the Torres Shelter of our own free will and spending the first three weeks of August on the streets. She has fibromyalgia and I'm Epileptic, with a tendency, especially in the heat of summer, to have seizures fairly often.\n\nWe had hoped that coming here would be the saving grace we needed...except that, at least for me, that hasn't been the case. Yes I'm in a pallet with my fiancee. It's more like an 8'x8'x10' shed. Portapotties are graffitied with profanity and sexualized commentary, even the odd gang symbol...music blares at all hours of the day, dogs snap at you as you walk by, food portions are abysmal.\n\nBut the absolute WORST is the lack of caring by the staff that run this place. I am BEYOND deeply disappointed. My stress has gone through the roof, increasing my seizure frequency, as well as being unable to sleep due to barking dogs, blaring music from both residents AND staff at all hours of the night, and people arguing both inside and outside of their pallets. I've seen needles and nitrous canisters lying around and in the toilets as well as gang symbols and not a SINGLE thing is ever done. We have mentioned the loud music affecting our physical health to the staff probably about 50 times, mostly by one individual and they are still here doing it. The common answer we received is \"it's not 10pm yet!\", which is when quiet hours begin. Do I even need to get into the residents who leave the pets droppings all over the place...?\n\nThis place needs to start following and enforcing the rules that THEY THEMSELVES put in place! It's not really that difficult! It is an absolute trash town within a beautiful city and they are ruining my mental health. If anyone is reading this... PLEASE HELP US!",

They are just another stone in the pond. Tonight I didn't have any protein for dinner. As they made the meal without any. They seemed to have made themselves lasagnas (the staff) and the cheese that they used could've been used for our meal. Yet they couldn't care less. If I had known that there would be no protein I would've got myself some from the store.

We had come based on an online listing we thought would make a good match in our home. We left with a different choice as fosters with an option to adopt. It took no time at all to decide and now we have new family. In our search we found that there are many who would use \u201crescue\u201d as a side hustle or a plain old scam to take advantage of folks who only want to share love. Not Rescue Ranch hard, hard working people who are giving so many a chance to love and be loved.",

So of course everybody has an opinion of what Christians should be doing or how they should be conducting business. But don't know any other place that offers a homeless shelter a day center, a nightly Christian service, a hot meal, food bags, clothing, hygiene kits, celebrate recovery, a sober living program, and a transitional housing program.

They need the city's help, but there isn't much coming, so they do it on their own. Come on Salinas, let's all pitch in !",
            "They charge $5 per night to get in, and management steals your bank card and ID, and they kick people out over every little thing, and they call the cops and have them beat you up. And they'll falsly accuse you with the intention of getting you put in jail.",
            "1st, the lead picture is misleading and not accurate, probably from not updating their page. I stayed their 5 months last winter from being homeless for the first time, and would not ever stay at Victory Mission again. The location and the old building are undesirable is an understatement and both are unhealthy in all ways."

After being involved in an accident and unable to work or provide for myself temporarily, this facility opened it's doors to me, to help me.\n\nThere is a doctor, psyche, case manager, and other resources on-site weekly. Generally, meals are provided otherwise it is relatively independent living. Males and Females are housed in separate, clean, accommodating, dorm-type living arrangements. Appliances on sight to help with clean apparel, which if you are lacking, can also be provided from local donations.\n\nA swift, safe, comfortable, and pleasant recovery from my accident was a blessing that I believe many people could also benefit from. The staff is wonderful and goes above and beyond every day to ensure the clients are happy.\n\nShasta Community Health Center/H.O.P.E provides the medical portion for patients while Pathways To Housing leads with the housing/facilities. Both are reputable organizations and if they offer you a referral, it will doubtless aide your situation. A gem of the community!",

I do come into contact very regularly with many of the homeless people in Redding and who passed through Redding. It's just kind of funny because almost every one of them who's been around a while has made use of the beneficence found at the mission but on the other hand they quickly move into all the negative things they can think of. Mostly and I hate to say it, it is just a lot of victim mentality and entitlements spirits working and the mission doesn't fulfill all of their desires so they end up being ingrates.\nI don't remember but I think it's been pushing 60 years since the mission has been here helping people. Come on! Only God does stuff like that."

            "I stayed at One SAFE Place and am greatful that I did. They were able to give me enough time to get on my feet with my children, find a job and housing. There were a couple of bad apples there with the other clients and gossip and all that garbage but that's to be expected in a house full of women. The staff at times was not entirely professional and a little gossipy too but that's life. If you are determined to get your life together after a bad relationship, this is the place. Focus on your goals and dreams and don't let the petty stuff ruin your journey.\nMy children and I are doing well in part to the help we got here.\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I am going to try to be really objective here.  This agency is really helpful if you are in a situation where you need to leave quickly AND you have family, friends or resources available to you after your stay. Here is where I have a problem.  The max stay at OSP is 45 days.  If you have nowhere to go after that or have no one to help you, you are going to end up back with your abuser who is now even angrier and more violent.  They don't disclose this when you call in.  It's just \"come in and we will help you\".  They really can't help you with housing because in Shasta county the wait for subsidized housing is a minimum of about 6 months for project based subsidized housing and much longer for a section 8 voucher. In my case, I met with Cyndi, who was amazing.  She had me use the OSP address when I applied for section 8 because I did not want the person I was leaving to find out what I was planning.  Somehow, Cyndi ended up not working there and when the housing agency sent my paperwork to them, they dropped the ball and I got purged from the list. When I returned to see what they could do.  I got no explanation or apology.  I met with a 20 something advocate who seemed pretty clueless and didn't seem too keen on contacting the housing authority to help sort this mess out. She kept hammering on a restraining order.  While a restraining order is helpful in some situations, it can be dangerous or damaging in others.  I.E. with a narcissist. I worked for 15 years in the counseling field so I know what I am talking about.  Staff needs to be trained in these nuances because these are people's lives.  Good intentions can quickly lead to bad consequences. It seems like there is pretty high turnover at this agency which is never a good thing.  I am not sure how they are funded but IMHO it is time to look at something like a transitional tiny home community with units that can fit individuals with children where they can have a stay long enough to truly address barriers like access to housing.  Again, I am not picking on OSP but I think they need to address some of these issues.",
            "I didnt like the head person when I went a few years ago she emotionally abused the women staying their and whole put them down how ever the rest of the staff I encountered recently where amazing and very helpful",
            "I\u2019m really confused about this place. I\u2019ve been in the hospital due to domestic violence and was given the emergency number, maybe I called the wrong one this time. The first time I called in October the lady had a cab who was going to come get me and take me to a hotel because I left and didn\u2019t feel safe. I ended up not leaving. Today I want to leave and a lady answered saying they don\u2019t do that and just asked about a restraining order. That makes no sense to me when I\u2019ve called before and got real help. Sounds wishy washy. I am in nursing school, no kids, family lives 4+ hours away with no car right now and needed help. This time I was let down and am being abused. I can\u2019t just be homeless.",
            "They only help whom they like to help. They accused my son of having multiple felonies AND HE HAS NONE! that was there excuse at first on why not to help. I asked the gentleman (who was extremely nice polite and helpful..Jackson) to go yell his boss my son has none and his boss came back idk her name she was extremely rude.

This is supposed to be a place for people to come that need help. And there was none of that. They don't care what anyone's situation is if your Homeless out in the streets even with kids or none of that.

It's the perfect combination of program and freedom to help you get back on your feet without overwhelming you and making you feel like you went from residential to residential. You still have your freedom with some exceptions the classes aren't too much and their helpful It's understandable a place as good as this would have such a waiting list. There should be one of these in every city",

            "Fell upon hard times and a difficult situation in May 2015; stayed there for 2 wks w/my two sons before I was inexplicably & unfairly told to leave for absolutely no good reason apparently. For a place that is supposedly trying to 'help' people, they are ridiculously intrusive on your privacy, as well as demeaning and disrespectful to you as a person. The vibe & atmosphere there feels very much like minimum security jail. Not the feeling one should have to experience when one is trying to move on and better their lives. A person named Tamara was the head when I was there; a very unfriendly and rude individual. I got the feeling that she does not like people of color, particularly black people. I understand we all have hard times & situations that may fall upon us, but I would definitely avoid this place like the plague if at all possible."

            "If you are motivated self-sufficient, trying to find permanent housing, and just in need of a safe place to get on your feet. This is not the place for you. They bring you under the guise that it is a homeless shelter, they first tell you your paying for shelter fees and that they want a 3 month commitment $650 a month for single bed in a shared room then once you sign you are told you are paying for \u201c the program\u201d no one is paying the same amount almost like they charge what they want to charge that moment but in reality \u201cthe program \u201c is being enforced by other homeless residents who can be found in their spare time panhandling at the local grocery store. They are taken advantage of women in need and most of the positive reviews are the favored residents and friends of the director I have filed reports with dhcs/dfeh THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HOMELESS WHOM THEY KNOW HAVE VERY LITTLE OPTIONS IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TAKE THEM THIS \u201cprogram\u201d is a set up",
            "The place is infested with mice and roaches!!! The directors refuse to call pest control all they do is bomb and put down boric acid which obviously is NOT working. boric acid is extremely poisonous and there are a lot of young children living there which is concerning. It\u2019s $400 for you and $100 per child. Some residents were paying over $800 to live in filth with bugs and rodents. It\u2019s extremely sad. Me and my child were sick our entire time at love a child, we didn\u2019t get better until we left. I had to take my child to the emergency room because a roach was stuck in their ear and my child was admitted and had to be treated for an infection with antibiotic's. The director dismissed me from the program because I had to stay overnight in the hospital with my child but honestly I was relieved because I did not want to return! They threatened to throw all of my belongings away if I did not retrieve by the end of the day. They wrote me up for missing church although I provided them a doctor\u2019s note stating that me and my child were sick. I constantly got written up because the rules are unclear and certain rules only apply to certain residents. The staff are residents but they get away with things that other residents get written up for. They\u2019re allowed to let their children play outside unattended with no shoes or proper clothes on but if another resident does that they are written up. The staff residents will literally write you up for anything just because they can. This program is obviously taking advantage of vulnerable women with children. Staff residents are obvious drug users but directors do not care. They do not drug test you upon acceptance into the program so they basically let anyone in. They say that they do random drug tests but the residents I talked to on a daily basis while I was there said they had never been drug tested during their time there. One resident even bragged about leaving to go smoke Meth. They do not provide any housing resources! They do not do case management! All they do is take your money and give you a bunk bed in a filthy cottage ingested with roaches and mice. BEWARE",
            "I was fleeing domestic violence, my abuser is actively searching for me. I was dismissed from the program for being in the main office at 7pm.\n\nI was a late intake the day previously and had support with my domestic violence advocate. I was extremely tired and didn\u2019t catch all of the information. I figured I would find out more the next day. I went to sleep, left the property early on the morning- before 645a to get to work. The website says that they help with transportation to work, THEY DONT. It took me 3 hours to get to work via bus and BART for a 3 hour shift, and another 2-3 hours to get back. I was gone all day.\n\nI called the program prior to arriving, letting them know I was gone at work and making my way back. I arrived back to the property around 645p and entered the office.  I went in to ask questions about the program, how to fill out my schedule, and what I needed to do for classes, etc. I left quite early in the morning and knew I missed information so I was just asking for tips.\n\nI am not familiar with Pittsburg at all and wanted to know more about the are, how to get around, advice and things like that. As I was talking to the woman, we talked about God, my journey, etc. I felt so much better. All of a sudden a woman named Courtney whom I have never met before or seen before came in to say that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be in there. She spoke to the woman as if I were not there and said something along the lines of \u201cyou can\u2019t let these people in here just tell them no. I saw the camera.\u201d It was extremely rude and unwelcoming and I calmly explained that I was a new intake, and wanted to know more information and I took it upon myself to come in and ask what the requirements were, what I missed, classes.\n\nThe woman, Courtney said I needed to leave and could finish tomorrow. She then started speaking down to the new employee. This new employee is part of their work adjustment program and only made $10 for the WHOLE 8 hour shift. I calmly explained again to Courtney that this woman was just trying to help. I\u2019m fleeing domestic violence and I\u2019m in an unfamiliar area. Courtney said someone would call me and explain. I don\u2019t believe that because nobody called me that day, I actually called in twice, and nobody knew who I was.\n\nI explained to Courtney that I didn\u2019t appreciate her tone and asked how they would get ahold of me since they failed to do so\u2026 and she quickly glanced at my work schedule and was like \u201cwe can have an appointment with you on Tuesday at 130p. I said that\u2019s fine but I want my DV advocate there. As I\u2019m trying to pack up to leave, she says, that Love a Child has no gates and I\u2019m free to leave whenever I want. I explained that that was not what I wanted and I was grateful to be there.\n\nI told her I wasn\u2019t feeling comfortable talking to her, explained I had a social work background, and legal background. She asked what does it have to do with the conversation. I explained that she was escalating the situation, I have PTSD. She got visibly upset, and said I was being insubordinate and I was dismissed from the program. I asked her to please call my advocate and that any discussions and decisions need to be made by her as my PTSD symptoms were exacerbated by her.\n\nShe proceeded to cal police and told them I was there refusing to leave property. I said alright thank you, please call my advocate. They could not get in touch with my advocate.\n\nAs I was walking back to my unit (where I had only been there one night), she approached me saying I was free to pack my stuff. I was already going to grab my stuff, what was the point of her approaching me like that? To exacerbate my symptoms even MORE?\n\nApparently Courtney goes to Bay Church Concord, I also attend there. I\u2019m so disappointed in how she handled the situation. This is not how a Christian behaves. I slept on the street last night. Had nothing with me and it was 50 degrees last night.\nIsaiah 54:17 is what gets me through. But I am so sad and hurt by the lack of support especially female support.",
            "Tbh I had the worst experience i was in the hospital take to mind I was pregnant they called me the next day after I delivered my baby that if I didn\u2019t pay my program fees I would lose my bed I had no where else to go I had my 2 kids my oldest 8 my middle 6 and my newborn they had no sympathy for what I was going through. This program lacks compaction and respect for there residents and the office needs lots of work Shannon needs to get out the office and Courtney needs to open her eyes. I am thankful but living at love a child shouldn\u2019t b hard like they make it.",
            "I didn\u2019t get the chance to stay here. But I did go through the application process . This shelter charges $450 for a single person to stay in a bed with also a $50 intake fee. This is a lot for someone who has zero income. They said that they would help even if you could not pay . But for me there\u2019s too many requirements that made my decision about staying here. One requirement that surprised me is that If your dr has prescribed meds to you, you have to be on them to come into this program. Which was a no for me because I was in the process of changing drs & the medication she had me on induced diabetes so I had to stop taking them. If you want to be in this program you have to take all meds prescribed by your doctor no excuses. I would not recommend based off how much you have to pay just to be provided a bed."

            "As old as this building is, this organization probably does the most in the city as far as what they have to offer, but they always get bashed because they are Christian organization. So of course everybody has an opinion of what Christians should be doing or how they should be conducting business. But don't know any other place that offers a homeless shelter a day center, a nightly Christian service, a hot meal, food bags, clothing, hygiene kits, celebrate recovery, a sober living program, and a transitional housing program. And they also work with CDCR and Geo called to stop program and yet they get very little money from the city, county, state or federal if any at all. It's all generated by the services they provide to other facilities and/or through donations",
            "I give Victory Mission 3 stars because what do you expect from a gospel homeless shelter. They provide a clean, safe, welcoming place to stay and a decent meal, and offer Bible based recovery programs for the men who seek shelter there. They need the city's help, but there isn't much coming, so they do it on their own. Come on Salinas, let's all pitch in !",
            "They charge $5 per night to get in, and management steals your bank card and ID, and they kick people out over every little thing, and they call the cops and have them beat you up. And they'll falsly accuse you with the intention of getting you put in jail.",
            "1st, the lead picture is misleading and not accurate, probably from not updating their page. I stayed their 5 months last winter from being homeless for the first time, and would not ever stay at Victory Mission again. The location and the old building are undesirable is an understatement and both are unhealthy in all ways."

            "My life changed dramatically at Rescue the children. The staff excepted me when i was broken and hopeless with open arms. I was in a dark place but I met God there and he broke that darkness off my life. The staff taught me how to love myself again and believe for more in my life because God had good plans for me. I learned working skills I never knew I had and how to serve as Christ did. I had never worked before but now I have been working there for over 4 years. In not one department but 3 different departments. They helped me go back to school and now I am a registered counselor. Of course I give all glory to God but it was God in the hearts of the staff and volunteers that restored my hope in humanity. I have witnessed lives changed day after day and will always be great full for The Fresno Mission all departments. Thank you and God Bless all the staff and men and women and children that.enter in",
            "Been supporting and volunteering with the mission over the last 6 months and they are amazing. God is blessing the efforts there through the disciples and staff. The staff is so caring and compassionate. If you are on the fence about getting involved, jump in! God is moving there and the work they do is saving lives on earth and for eternity!",

As well as job placement assistance.It was a total life change. I just want to thank the mission for taking me off the streets and showing me how to live A life of sobriety.",
            "I was rather shocked listening to the recent (Jan 2022) television campaign launched by the Fresno Mission listing all of the terrible things that can cause a crisis: \"I'm a single mom with five kids, one of whom is autistic, and I cannot keep it all together crisis. We have a, \"I didn't choose this life.\" crisis.\n\nAs a mother of an autistic child who watches TV, I thought to myself, how would I explain this to my child if he was watching right now? When there are so many disabilities that can afflict a child and family, why did they single out autism specifically as a contributor to this mother's crisis? Surely I know that having any special needs child is a challenge, but shouldn't we just call them \"special needs\" in an ad campaign. Why single out a certain group in a negative way like this. I strongly oppose cancel culture and having to be politically correct all of the time. But to single out a vulnerable population by name like this is really insensitive."

            "Upon hearing about the shelter I was pretty optimistic about the things i heard from a county sheriff. Once I got in there and an spoken to an employee at the front desk work. In the moment i was optimistic for the future for good reasons as she was a very kind, respectful, and genuinely empathetic of my situation..\nThis optimism quickly went away after having the first meeting with my caseworker whose job was supposedly to help me out with finding and securing permanent housing. Not only did she label my case as a self resolve case meaning that when it comes to trying to find permanent housing in the city it would still be completely on me. she had no real help to offer. That in itself was very disappointing news for me at a very hard time but on top of having to receive the disappointing news she also talked to me like I was completely incompetent and in grade school the entire time !!! making me feel very belittled and overall worse about myself for putting myself in the situation. Understandable to believe that someone who is my age at the age of 23 must\u2019ve done a bunch of bad stuff To get him in the position financially that im in but from what my grandmother had told me originally just because someone has bad character (although i dont) doesn\u2019t justify bad action. In the remainder of the week I was there. The span of my stay being only about a week and a half maybe two weeks I\u2019ve been assaulted by my roommate and when I say assaulted I mean I woke up to a 6\u20192 close to 300 pound 19-year-old hitting me in my face . after already voicing my concerns about my roommate to one of the workers that were there during the night shift. to add to it upon my departure from the shelter after my bed was closed by my case worker\nFor coming in past curfew although I had every form of excuse They had originally said would be Accepted On top of a job I was working full-time The promises of storage that was given to me which I have in text stated that I would have 30 days to ultimately grab all of my things or it would be disposed of or donated. Three days into my supposed storage I went back to the shelter to collect my things with a mentor of sorts only to be told that somehow my things had been stolen. Even considering the situation I was in and the loss of what I\u2019d like to say most of my life savings there were still no empathy from any of the workers or any real investigation done to figure out what happened to any of my things as far as I see it when it comes to anybody who fits my description you\u2019re probably better off getting a storage on your own and just sleeping on the streets because not only will you be undermineded and taunted for your current position you will also put yourself in the position of being victimized by the people that claim they want to help you!!",
            "Amazing place, giving young adults every opportunity to get their ducks in a row and get some help financially as well. Lots of rules but nothing outlandish. Can't say enough good things about this program and how it helped me.",

Just a bunch of bums taking care of bums. So they aren't educated or aspire to be better. They are content with being who they are and in a world of content people. They are just another stone in the pond. Tonight I didn't have any protein for dinner. As they made the meal without any. They seemed to have made themselves lasagnas (the staff) and the cheese that they used could've been used for our meal. Yet they couldn't care less. If I had known that there would be no protein I would've got myself some from the store. I had no idea they were going to serve a meal that lacked nutrition at the most basic level so I'm actually surprised.",

However, I was so far removed from all of the snares and chaos of my life, that it was a relief. I didn't know anyone in Santa Maria, but was glad! I was connected to County services so I could get well, and back to work, and housed again (without a voucher too)! I just needed solid ground to get my footing. Long story short, when it rains, it pours! I experienced a whirlwind of unfortunate events during and after after the pandemic, to the extent I became unable to work, unable to cope, and needed help!\n\nThe entire staff was great! From my observation, if you treat the staff with respect, they will treat you with respect. If you follow their rules, things will become very easy for you. If you are honest with yourself and staff, things will become very easy for you! They are firm on their policy, as they should be, because they are dealing with lots of people, from various backgrounds. Rise up, to hold yourself accountable for your actions. The staff members at Good Samaritan evaluated my entire situation, and connected me to the services that are now paving the way for success, long after leaving sober living. I can't wait to get to my next destination in life, so I can give back just as soon as I can. I will never forget you all, and cherish Good Samaritan deeply.",

If you have any accomodations needed, not only will they not be met(after you try to get approved before hand) but you will also be talked to as though you are worthless. Case managers are even worse. Yolanda shows no professional attitude: she either acts as your best friend or talks to you like a middle school bully. Janie is useless and incompetent, and frequently issues notices to clients with incorrect or outdated information and typos. All of them make false promises on housing opportunities and show no sympathy when those promises fall through. But if the client doesn't deliver on their \"promises\" they will not be understanding because:\nThey do not care, at all, about homeless people.",

            "I lived there and after Renea left and Divine took over, it got a lot better. Then I think the power went to Divines head and he forgot it was a homeless shelter and not a prison. So many new rules coming from every direction, one after another. The project to turn the largest part of the dorm to medical beds only and throwing the men and women together. Firing some very vital, long- time staff members, Divines \"my way or the highway\" attitude. And the favouritism that is still shown to some of the clients there is unexplainable. I think Divine and Esmeralda need to print out a copy of the original \"MISSION STATEMENT\" and read it over and over again until they remember why they are there and exactly what being homeless has put a lot of their clients through. The trauma, the uncertainty, the danger, the fear, the horrors, the abandonment, loss, addictions, mental instabilities, and pain. These points are long forgotten at D st. shelter now and atany other shelters as well. I give Dst Shelter 1 star because they've lost the ability to show empathy, understanding, and support to those of us who REALLY need it\nGod Bless.",

            "I've interacted with Empower Tehema at their office on 2 seperate occassions and once at the Sheriffs Department last week.\n\nI would like to think they are there to support the victim and their family, but so far that's not what I am seeing.\n\nI am very nervous about this agency.\n\nWhen my friend went to them for help in the past she was turned away and told there was nothing they could do for her.\n\nIt wasn't until CPS sent my friend back to them that they finally started my friends paperwork.\n\nI get the impression they are trying to frame my friend even though they know she came forward and was rejected/turned away.\n\nWhat I found surprising during the forensic interview was that the Empower staff had Starbucks deliver a large amount of drinks and pastries but failed to offer it to the victim or her family.\n\nA Sherriff did offer me one of the coffee's and I accepted but was never given it.\n\nI kept waiting for it and finally asked, but was provided a cup of coffee from the Sheriff's coffee machine.\n\nI wasn't mad, I can afford to buy my own coffee.\n\nIt was just a thoughtless action and very poor manners.\n\nI ponder where the funds came from that paid for the Starbucks food & beverages. Did those monies come from a victims fund?\n\nWhat was worse was the message that thoughtless action sent which was \"you may be the victims, but we are the team\".\n\nI hope they rethink such activities in the future and think of the victims before themselves.\n\nAll I can do at this point is hope for the best, wait and see.\n\nI will be back to update this review when all is said and done."

They would rather keep you there than to help with what you're needing/asking help with : leaving Chico. Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

The amount of work, love, and patience that Ms Wilkins and Ms Barbara put in this place every day is magnificent.\nI came into this program with absolutely no life skills, no ambitions, no money, poor parenting skills, nasty eating habits, no communication skills and poor cleaning habits. I can full whole heartedly say that The staff at Mary\u2019s Haven help me step by step to change into a better person and a better mother. They put their heart and soul into this job. Helping those who are willing to make a change and still willing to help those who aren\u2019t quite ready by pushing them into the right direction. I can\u2019t forget to mention the love they have for each and every child that comes in with no hesitation. They make the children feel loved. My son absolutely loves all the staff here.

            "We just tried calling the mission and the person who responded was very short with us and sent us through a bunch of hoops to jump through that don't make any sense. As an example: we are homeless and they want us to provide proofs of income which is impossible when you are homeless and have no money. I don't know of anyone who provides a pay stub of nothing to the homeless to prove that they don't make anything and if you don't provide proof of these things your application will be immediately denied. This really does appear to be just another non-profit making money off of people's kind hearts.   I don't understand how a Christian non-profit can hire someone who's so short-tempered and have such a bad attitude. It seems to be the opposite of christ-like to look down on people and judge them before you even know who's on the other line... Probably just another holy roller who likes to pretend that they're christ-like and get the accolades for it when in reality they're constantly judging people. It's very disheartening to call these places when you're really down and you're living out of a car and the only thing you're asking for is some food and instead you get met with terrible attitudes. I'm sure someone will log on here and say they're really sorry about the bad attitude that we went up against but it's not going to feed my family it's not going to give them temporary housing and it's not going to make them feel like God is on their side... It's people like the woman who answered the phone that make the world a worse place and allow people to lose their faith in humanity maybe she forgot that Jesus died for everyone's sins not just hers. Maybe I'm being too judgmental but then again I'm the one who's asking for free food that they get donated to them. So if my family and I aren't good enough to get the free food they get donated to them I really hope that people just stop donating to them and start donating to other organizations that'll be more helpful and less judgmental.... You know like Jesus Christ was.... And my name's NOT Layton. He's just another soul who didn't receive help. Start giving hand ups, not hand outs!! Most of your type of organizations help the addicts, not struggling families with jobs. I'm gonna open a better organization than yours when I get on my feet. This is pathetic. Layton? Lol.

We went to alternative school, and did chores, lots of memories had a good friend go home on a home pass and never came back,  months later we found out he got shot in the head. The kid survived but was never the same, tht moment changed my life.

It's racism and he should be kicked to the curb. He does it to all kinds of people. A lot. Than the staff has his back when he is way wrong. He is destroying people's lives ( not mine I'm always good) but others yes. It's complete racism someone needs to look into it it's sick. And I've heard from staff that they have let people die there on purpose. I don't know if that's true but the staff said it and i think that's morbid. I love helping people so when people who are supposed too do like that it makes me vomit in my mouth. Sick. Janitors a dirtbag needs reprimand.

            "Do not care about it's clients have never been called into the office or given a case worker to advocate for me in my state of homelessness like many other organizations here in San Diego? Sometimes, I wonder if I am even welcome here as a service connected disabled Transgender M2f Iraq war combat female veteran! I am currently banned from even using the services like being fed as a homeless woman, let alone being seen as a homeless woman and not called a man, or dude, or brother. Can't even take a shower and shave my face to feel more like the woman I am. Have to stay away for 90 days because some woman wanted something of mine and decided that she was going to claim that I stole it from her and since they can't prove I did or didn't and it is here say then I can no longer get to feel like a female and actually come to relax and sit somewhere for a while, without getting pushed around by the safety people herding us around the city like cattle because some self imposed more important than every other being down below in their high rise towers so the further they ascend the more people they step on and cannot even have the courtesy to reply back when told good morning, or have a great day because they have their ear buds in so they don't have to listen to the poor beggars trying to survive when everyone in their city is against them and they check into different organizations and none get back with them for housing purposes, or any other kind of outreach, we fall through the cracks even those of us actively seeking a home and somebody who loves us enough to even care. Get put on a list that more and more people get added to so you get cast aside because you don't fit the proper Mold of who/what is acceptable.",

            "Many accusations of racist, bias, insecure,  unprofessional staff. I witnessed and experienced a lot of this. A crowded emergency shelter dorm, that had close to a dozen people sick for weeks. There was no health protocol until more than a month after a multitude of residents were sick. Beds were striped when people left but not disinfected. Often no soap in soap dispensers. Bed frames had caked on dirt on them. Disparities in who is helped, and the type of help given. Several people also had food poisoning. A resident was allowed to use a full size bed, to store her belongings. Dorm has cameras. A woman walked around in a tiny white towel, two different days while sweeping, and combing out her hair. An older female staff person made her go put clothes on. There are teenage boys in the dorm. Male staff do not announce that they are entering the dorm area. Several non Hispanic women, who were white, black, and multi raced alleged that they are surprised a certain Mexican female advocate was still allowed to work there, that allegedly she told a disabled person if she continues to complain about medical issues and her rights that she would be exited, that she told a family that a housing program was full, when it wasn't. This staff person hung up the phone on me, when I declined to have an additional useless meeting with her. A lot of times an agenda of shuffling people to various shelters was pushed, even if a better option was in progress. A worker kicked out a mother with three children over something trivial. The woman and her children slept on a nearby bus stop bench. Chores are mandatory or you could get written up. Three write ups and you could get kicked out. I did not have any write ups but The Rescue Mission refused to state that in writing, which could hinder my housing prospects. There was only one staff person in the Emergency Shelter who was fair and consistent with everyone, and always exuded God's love. Many staff did not speak to me, did not say hello, did not say thank you, did not say you're welcome, several were even rude. I rolled my eyes in frustration, but stayed formal in spite of their treatment. A proactive, healthy, trauma informed staff, would know that customer service and salutations are the responsibility of the staff and not the client. Late in the night, two younger staff made a crude remark. I caught one of them sleeping on the job twice. Multiple staff laughed and talked about clients. This behavior includes the Manager. I overheard her tell a staff person, she didn't want to tell me I had a week's extension. I had to inquire twice. They were going to let me exit without telling me. The people who stroked staff egos, got more help, and better treatment. Most staff stand by each other no matter what. Positives about the place are any staff that treat everyone with equal treatment, there is always some portion of edible food, free laundry and supplies, a place to sleep at night, a weekly clothing closet, some great volunteers, a wonderful man at the front desk who said, the place changed his life, and an amazingly kind, just, ray of hope and light, who is the Associate Director of the Mission Academy, Sara!",
            "This was/is a tough review to write. My toughest. They SHOULD AND COULD be everything they purport to be, it's very VERY sad that they have a chance to help and so few staff and administration take it. They denied us opportunities for shelter because they viewed me as a problem. The fact that we aren't on the literal street is amira le thanks only to God\nThis \"faith based\" program lies and uses coercion as they see fit, to have people doing what they want.\nWe ended up sick multiple times because of the unsanitary habits with chores and the bathrooms and total lack of soap for hand washing for 3 days, or the lack of cleaning the showers for people, the lack of cleanliness in the common areas and etc. When we reported illnesses -- as THEY directed, they punished us for being called contagious by Doctors (as they demanded we consult) and needing an isolation room to stop spreading the illness. Other people they denied isolating and let the illness spread through the dorm and didn't care.\nThere ARE a few staff members that genuinely care about the people at the Mission but MOST of them don't. It saved us from the he literal street for about a month and a half and we sometimes got edible food and it encountered decent or even kind humans. It is what it is. Do the best you can. \ud83e\ude75",

            "My rating is 3.72, but I have to use full stars so I\u2019ll round up. If you\u2019re coming in off the streets or recent imprisonment, ECTLC is a great start. As a sober, non-criminal victim of domestic abuse who found myself homeless with no family, the program didn\u2019t live up to its promise and I left for a sober living home after 3 months.\n\nThe biggest problem was, no matter how much I begged, case management wouldn\u2019t do anything. I have a custody battle to fight, a former employer retaliation case to fight, need to transfer my drivers license to California, needed to sign up for EBT and relief, and just basic homeless assistance. I was able to work out the EBT and GR but I had to do it all on my own, which was challenging with how disconnected from the world they keep clients.\n\nWhen I began to serve in the men\u2019s ranch office, the case manager constantly belittled my contributions. The office was too dusty, I sent emails too early, I texted him genuine concerns when he wanted to be left alone, I didn\u2019t magically empty the office trash before actually walking into the office where the trash was, I responded to an email to express interest in a proposed set alcohol use disorder meetings, saying I wanted to attend and listen, which was unacceptable. Then he made a fool out of me in front of everyone in the sanctuary for not getting another client to their tele-health therapy appointment on-time, a duty that should be his responsibility as case manager and staff, not a client in phase one.\n\nYes, I have the sober mindset and office skillset for that \u201cjob\u201d, but the job wasn\u2019t mine. I was there for therapy. I was there for the promised respite, not to face rebuke and scorn and get taken advantage of.\n\nI exited myself and have been able to get much more done for my \u201ccase management\u201d in 4 days of sober living. It\u2019s a shame, and it was a really difficult decision, but I go where God calls me, even if it seems weird at first glance.\n\nHowever, I made amazing friends. The most humble men that I will still see at the center\u2019s church.",

When no other program would help ECTLC never turned their back on use. Services ECTLC offer has truly changed our life's. This program is doing the God's work.",
            "I can see it being a great place for a hard-core former drug user or going there for temporary shelter. From my experience I was there for a few days and they push you you go to this \"Ranch\" but never tell you what it's like. They take all your technology and force you to go 3 months with only talking to family or friends for 10 minutes a week. Seems more like punishment than help. From what I explained you can't even look for a job untill month 9 of a 1 year program. Seems like the goal is to get free labor for 9 months while you get nothing and absolutely no freedoms. It's literally one step above Prison.\n\nSo like I said it is a good place for maybe a felon coming out of prison or a user who can't even be around the city or they will relapse. On the other hand if you just need a few months of shelter to secure a job and get your life together they have no ambition of helping you unless you help them first. I was told they have to homework on the Bible which is cool, building structure but 9 months of fake Bible camp really doesn't help you in the real world if you are trying to get a home.\n\nOverall 1 star great for emergency shelter, terrible program. Their goal is to get you to the ranch and indoctrinate in their system. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a Cult, but it is pretty close in definition. I left personally after 3 days with a injured leg cause I'd try my chances on the street than deal with that mess for a year.",
            "I was lucky enough to get a bed and this is a wonderful program that if there's availability they will take you right in. They offer you showers fresh meals three times a day and a prayer group and a bed to sleep in yet the bed is 22 to a room. I found with people coughing and hacking I ended up getting sick so I left. One thing I did not like was the girl in charge of the room was just a recovering addict with an attitude. She was in charge and seemed to take the role as if it gave her the right to judge so she can feel elevated. What does wonderful is if you have clothing if needed and personal supplies and pretty good meals three times a day. I feel if you are not addicted to drugs or alcohol, it may not be the best because after 30 days they want to send you to a farm not a real farm that would be amazing but a farm where they take away your phone and contact with the outside world or ability to go to school or ability to work and you're basically isolated for 3 months and tell you are put back into the program again and then you're able to clean it's a great start great program but if you just have fleeing or needing to restart your life over it's not a good program for you. It seems to be ideal for those who are at the hands of substance abuse of any kind or mental disorder."

There are crates for your dog or cat next your bed, there isnt private rooms but mostly everyone is respectful. They have clothes if in need, rock painting, prayer, clean bathrooms, showers that have shampoo/conditioner/body soap, grateful to have been helped here.

            "Ok, so if the majority of peeps read my posts you would have known I'm homeless living out of a tent, not by choice it was a loss of housing and then being scammed of $4500 in which I never got back. Instead of staying down in the dirt I stayed standing to continue rising up. So here I am at the San Diego Rescue Mission in Oceanside CA. I rated give stars bc it's a beautiful facility with awesome smiling eager to help you build staff. I will start with Kat she has a beautiful heart ND cares how u feel, then there's Kay she's very direct full of resources and gives u homework to ensure you are doing the foot work to build up. I mean why not?? If your not working u have plenty of time, right? Then there's James very humble cares about your needs and wants to help. Michael making sure us ladies keep our area clean and will give u fix it tickets to organize, yes! I got one but not bc I'm sloppy it's I did not have a 2nd bin they thought I had. that's just to name a few. In regards to residents ok to be honest the majority are sane neat and clean then u have your Insane that are, well u can fill that part in but the staff will do there best to ensure hygiene is priority ( Thank God :-). Beds and linens are cleaned weekly, beds are comfortable and floors, Wells and other areas are clean. At times if staff has suspicions they will follow thru with you and the area u sleep at. I know owner statement is a 30days shelter, well some residents have been given extensions for a 90days. This is a temporary housing facility and it doesn't mean u will move from here into a home of your own before your times up. It is possible IF YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK!! IF NOT, well guess what?? Your back on the streets maybe in a tent... I know that will not be me!!! So this is my story, you best believe I'm sticking to it. Have a good day with Blessings your way"

While visiting her home, we were struck by how happy all of the dogs were, and healthy too. We would recommend HPHS to anyone seriously looking for their perfect pet!",
            "The people who run High Plateau Humane Society are professional and caring.  They have done extensive work on the facility, improved  the cat enclosure, and do their best to find homes for dogs and cats.  I greatly appreciate their presence and their contributions to the animal world and to our tiny community.  We are fortunate to have such an active humane society in our isolated area.",
            "Very helpful and responsive. I was just passing through town and reported a stray cat hanging around my hotel. A volunteer responded to my message right away, and the cat was in their care a day later. A happy ending for the sweet cat, and one less breeding male roaming and mating! Great rescue, much appreciated.",
            "Please look for another adoption agency if you are looking for dogs. I believe that the woman that runs the dog adoptions is fraudulently taking money from people. Her name is Jennifer Anderson. Everything that she told us was incorrect. The adoption fee of $350 included the chip (that she gave to us in a baggy), first puppy shots and $100 to be refunded when we showed proof of neuter. She spoke at length  about how important it was to neuter at roughly 6 months, because of hormones and growth. Also, Ms. Anderson was very aggressive in her request that we make out own dog food. To the point that I thought she wouldnt let us adopt if we didnt agree with the request. When we took our new puppy to our vet, we found out that he already had a chip, and they strongly requested that we NOT make our own food unless we're consulting with a dog nutritionist. 6 months go by and we're patiently waiting for our puppy's balls to drop and surprisingly they never did. After contact with Ms. Anderson 7 months later, she said that she had forgotten and our puppy had already been neutered. That's kind of a big forget. She also told me not to listen to my vet about dog nutrition. She had done the \"research\" and she knew better. It should be noted that Ms. Anderson is not a veterinarian, but she is a moron. I encourage Alturas to find another person to run their dog adoptions."

Instead of the 3rd he will now receive a much smaller check \"about the third week\" of each month.  We tried to talk to Social Services and they said to call Social Security. Social Security said to go to their on line site, which is no help at all.  Now what?  Called mental health, but can only leave a message that is not answered.",

            "I submitted an application for a wood voucher in December and have heard nothing since, though I stopped by two days before Christmas, placed a call and sent an email today. It's understood that time is required for this, but a return call seems appropriate in this case considering that we have had several inches of snow fall. My experience with TEACH prior to this has been fairly good, the thrift store is excellent and everything moves smoothly in the food line, but trying to actually apply for something seems to be very difficult for some and no problem at all for others. This is disappointing, and I hope to hear from someone soon, given that I heat my home with a woodstove and have been getting along by the kindness of a friend's friends. At this rate I will be unable to comfortably suggest TEACH as a place to obtain help when it's truly needed.",

I even reported it to the ombudsman. There was also another report of abuse for the same foster home at the same time. Everything was swept under the rug nothing was done My children are still being abused right now.",

It must have been expired for over a year or left out for very long periods. A man was on the floor and an ambulance was called. I would've given just 1 star for this outrage but some staff member at the desk by the name of Peter or Steve was such a cool person that he saved this place from losing 2 stars. He's the guy with the sunglasses and a ponytail. I would personally give him 5 Stars if I could",

            "The Mercy House in Bako is the Taj Majal of shelters. Residents of Bakersfield truly invest in their community. A micro- city operated by amazing, compassionate, humane and loving individuals that are at the sand at your feet. Nestled in a beautiful setting, three daily meals cooked by a chef, laundry and medical facilities on site..\nA wonderful opportunity that I will always be endowed too. A million and half thanks to the administration, management team and support staff for their tireless effort and daily smiles. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc26",
            "I think homeless shelters are amazing,  helping people to stay off the streets and giving people a place to lay their heads and providing people with a nice warm meal, buuuut....I don't understand why homeless shelters don't have a program in place to help those who are homeless. Help people to get their lives back on track. This place allows people to sleep all day and get comfortable with their situation, instead of helping them they allow people to stay down and be ok with being homeless.  I don't understand this, they should participate and help out while they stay there. Help them build structure and help them get jobs. This place is pretty much a kick back spot and do whatever you please kind of place. I think giving people a warm place to lay their heads and a warm meal is truly awesome, but that can't be all there is to it , right? They definitely need a program to help them get their lives back in track. That's just my opinion. I understand people have situations they have no control over and I'm not judging, cause who am I to judge. I just think there should be a program to help people who truly need the help and who want it.",
            "This place is not well structured they need a better security check and drug testing station. Most want housing some just don't want to be in the cold smoking their drugs. It's always hot the air conditioning system stays on cool but fan auto that is not air from the system, the heater is too hot too many ppl coughing no germs will be killed here during winter more ppl will die from illness. Bathroom stalls are gross, shower liners need changing, shower stalls need cleaning from other people hair. Trash cans full and gross, hardly any toilet paper or paper towels. It is always male staff entering the dorms never a female they all work behind the desks. The food is not always consumable. People walk past your head all night and early morning. Pets should not be allowed inside unless they are service dogs with a harness on. Too much goes on. Not enough structure,  but we can't walk off the premises like we confined to this place like prisoners. They are not navigating the way they should or more individuals would be housed.",

One liere and that I am not . They intimmad u . Then others says one day I should leave there fellow worker alone because he got worte up what's that a bout all I went here was for housing not have fear I could get xeded at any time because of a complaint"

They hype this place up so damn much and they pretend and act like they want to help!

Further more everybody is constantly fighting and arguing the theft is unreal and the staff looks down and talks down to the homeless constantly everyday!!! For dinner they feed you half a pb&j sandwich, a banana, and a yogurt if you like to eat like an adult should then this place is not for you I am 63, I have a service dog and I disabled and they treated me like dirt and kicked me and my dog out and let the young kid stay I now have vet bills for my service dogs injuries and I am on the sidewalk with nothing and no where to go I hope and I pray that i find a way soon that flood took me far away from everything I knew and when I called them at 2 pm on a Friday I was told to tough it out and to call them on Monday one more thing almost everybody there was on drugs its an absolute mad house",

We must leave at 6:30 AM or we will be towed off. You cannot stay on the premises in your car so all we can go to the park that\u2019s close by and gas is really expensive so half the time we can probably make it there, my husband was trying to get some gas money to get it back into the shelter and we were late so we couldn\u2019t get anything to eat time before that my husbands looking for gas to get us out of the shelter to make sure so we don\u2019t get back in time before the gate closed the bus ran late so he had to walk in the ran to us the security refused to let him in because he was late and her excuse. Do you have to teach them a lesson to show up on time? even though my husband, Paul, the security lady that was his RV with his wife and son in it he was running late from the bus and she still refuse Lehman. He stayed by the gate all night on because his phone is dead and wet could not call for help to let them know he was gonna be running late from the bus battalion if they offer is Food for safe parking if you live inside the shelter, you get all the benefits of a shower a bathroom, 3 square meals, laundry place to keep warm but if you want more, do you have to stay in",

My friend and I were late on Wednesday 17th of May 2023 we missed our bus coming from oildale and when we got back it was 8pm. Came back the next day and they threw mine and her stuff away that night didn't even hold it for five days like they should",

Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down.

From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

Although long time managers F and Sh are great! Very good managers. Very good people. They are encouraging and supportive. they are understanding and also firm when they need to be. Those two really belong there. They know how to manage efficiently and very well for all who stay and work there",
            "Stayed At The House On & Off. By far only 1 Manager was rude & unpleasant, Luckily she got fired so no more worries ;) Also always good food thanks to their two best cooks (you guys know who you are) It has its ups & downs. But when there its all about structure. So if your acting out of line and they call the cops on you it doesn't make anyone snitchs. Its called policy. I'm giving Hospitality House 4/5 Stars. My main reason of 4 instead of 5 is that they need to start testing everyone that comes in there and start monitoring those who sneak out past 9pm curfew. The favoritism needs to stop too. It's good to have favorites however business is business. Tracy knew that as a supervisor. Just cause he was friends with certain people. Doesn't mean you get to go out late at night and have fun, or smoke in the bathrooms, etc. Other than that the supervisors aren't the problem its the residents. I can say a lot of names, but i'll leave it there.",

            "I\u2019ll start by saying that the majority of staff at CHS are wonderful, dedicated people and the animals are well taken care of. However, the director at this location is notorious for treating her employees unfairly, putting in as little effort as possible, and maintaining a hands-off approach when it comes to the animals - all while earning a very generous salary. This is a small, tight-knit community and the amount of ex-employees/volunteers that have expressed discontent with the leadership here is astonishing, and should not be ignored.",
            "This review is not for staff that takes care of animals, they are awesome. The board and Director are the problem. Why is it this 501c has a problem holding back money for operating expenses?\nThey were unable to buy a computer for there administrative assistant, so she had to use her own. They lost a wonderful secretary, because of this. Now they're on facebook asking for a computer because theirs went down. Are you serious.",
            "Director is paid approx 6 figures, doesn\u2019t touch animals and mistreats her staff. Facility bypasses all local impounds to cherry pick animals from further away. Board members consistently disregard valid employee concerns, financial mismanagement, and employee abuse. Donate your funds elsewhere!",

You can get help every few years if you take time to gathers your facts and papers, proof , or whatever they require. It does depend on if they have funding at the time.

They do absolutely nothing to provide the help people need. They just perpetuate the problems of this town. The workers were clients themselves, but where is the actual social work experience? They don't dispense soap for the bathroom, and people don't wash their hands, nor kids. Plus roaches, plus mold, and some staff member is allergic to bleach, so we're not allowed to use it at certain times. No wonder so many people were sick for weeks on end. They stopped accepting donations. You're treated like an idiot or a child at times. They let people scream and curse at their children. The rules are enforced depending on who is working. My case manager Jessica lied to me about giving me an extension of two weeks. She told staff that I was still leaving as scheduled and it caught me off guard. This place and its employees need an undercover to investigation. Please, please. See how this place is ran. You would be appalled. How does one report this place?",
