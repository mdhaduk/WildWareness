            "The Mercy House in Bako is the Taj Majal of shelters. Residents of Bakersfield truly invest in their community. A micro- city operated by amazing, compassionate, humane and loving individuals that are at the sand at your feet. Nestled in a beautiful setting, three daily meals cooked by a chef, laundry and medical facilities on site..\nA wonderful opportunity that I will always be endowed too. A million and half thanks to the administration, management team and support staff for their tireless effort and daily smiles. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc26",
            "I think homeless shelters are amazing,  helping people to stay off the streets and giving people a place to lay their heads and providing people with a nice warm meal, buuuut....I don't understand why homeless shelters don't have a program in place to help those who are homeless. Help people to get their lives back on track. This place allows people to sleep all day and get comfortable with their situation, instead of helping them they allow people to stay down and be ok with being homeless.  I don't understand this, they should participate and help out while they stay there. Help them build structure and help them get jobs. This place is pretty much a kick back spot and do whatever you please kind of place. I think giving people a warm place to lay their heads and a warm meal is truly awesome, but that can't be all there is to it , right? They definitely need a program to help them get their lives back in track. That's just my opinion. I understand people have situations they have no control over and I'm not judging, cause who am I to judge. I just think there should be a program to help people who truly need the help and who want it.",
            "This place is not well structured they need a better security check and drug testing station. Most want housing some just don't want to be in the cold smoking their drugs. It's always hot the air conditioning system stays on cool but fan auto that is not air from the system, the heater is too hot too many ppl coughing no germs will be killed here during winter more ppl will die from illness. Bathroom stalls are gross, shower liners need changing, shower stalls need cleaning from other people hair. Trash cans full and gross, hardly any toilet paper or paper towels. It is always male staff entering the dorms never a female they all work behind the desks. The food is not always consumable. People walk past your head all night and early morning. Pets should not be allowed inside unless they are service dogs with a harness on. Too much goes on. Not enough structure,  but we can't walk off the premises like we confined to this place like prisoners. They are not navigating the way they should or more individuals would be housed.",

Then others says one day I should leave there fellow worker alone because he got worte up what's that a bout all I went here was for housing not have fear I could get xeded at any time because of a complaint"

They have cameras unlike the mission so if some one steals your stuff they get the boot, they do help u get housing but it takes time",

They hype this place up so damn much and they pretend and act like they want to help! But, my service dog had to fight off other dogs that we're not service dogs the whole two weeks that I stayed at this 5 star resort!!! Further more everybody is constantly fighting and arguing the theft is unreal and the staff looks down and talks down to the homeless constantly everyday!!! For dinner they feed you half a pb&j sandwich, a banana, and a yogurt if you like to eat like an adult should then this place is not for you I am 63, I have a service dog and I disabled and they treated me like dirt and kicked me and my dog out and let the young kid stay I now have vet bills for my service dogs injuries and I am on the sidewalk with nothing and no where to go I hope and I pray that i find a way soon that flood took me far away from everything I knew and when I called them at 2 pm on a Friday I was told to tough it out and to call them on Monday one more thing almost everybody there was on drugs its an absolute mad house",

            "The sign on the outside of the place is for the fire Marshal, it says it a fire station. Also it's not open 24 hours. I've driven by there and there are no vehicles parked around this location or in the parking lot at all.",
            "For people that stay in there car for safe parking they only get one meal and if u r late for it by 5 minutes u don\u2019t eat and they know you only get one meal because they said they will give u a worker to help u get assistance with food and housing, medical and social but they have not even gotten a hold of us to let us know what day to be there and make an appointment because I know it\u2019s a very busy day times that by appointments they aren\u2019t even call us even ask us questions we are not allowed to stay on the premises. We must leave at 6:30 AM or we will be towed off. You cannot stay on the premises in your car so all we can go to the park that\u2019s close by and gas is really expensive so half the time we can probably make it there, my husband was trying to get some gas money to get it back into the shelter and we were late so we couldn\u2019t get anything to eat time before that my husbands looking for gas to get us out of the shelter to make sure so we don\u2019t get back in time before the gate closed the bus ran late so he had to walk in the ran to us the security refused to let him in because he was late and her excuse. Do you have to teach them a lesson to show up on time? even though my husband, Paul, the security lady that was his RV with his wife and son in it he was running late from the bus and she still refuse Lehman. He stayed by the gate all night on because his phone is dead and wet could not call for help to let them know he was gonna be running late from the bus battalion if they offer is Food for safe parking if you live inside the shelter, you get all the benefits of a shower a bathroom, 3 square meals, laundry place to keep warm but if you want more, do you have to stay in",

Your exited and they don't hold your stuff for five days like they say they do they throw it out. Also there's no grace period when your late. It was 8pm they close the gate now it's 730pm. My friend and I were late on Wednesday 17th of May 2023 we missed our bus coming from oildale and when we got back it was 8pm. Came back the next day and they threw mine and her stuff away that night didn't even hold it for five days like they should",

The staff here treat you like your IQ is less than of an infant and inforce rules that are unethical. The residents here are unbelievably senseless and irresponsible and small minded ppl.and the worse part is being locked out of the dorms all day including the heat.most ppl who can't be in the heat due to medical conditios stay lock from 1pm- 3pn  Everything there is unorganized and no one follows the rules kids unsupervised all the time and. In. My defense I have a past here and I know more than anyone that place needs to be thoroughly looked at this place isn't what they make it out to seem a happy and go lucky place when it's a disaster behind closed doors. Kids peeing on the floor and no one does anything about it. No parents and no staff to be seen.",

There are plenty of problems with the place and the way its run, but it makes the best it can given what and who it has to work with. Please donate gently used items of any kind, I really mean anything a human can use, it helps more than you would believe."

The decorations, the Girlscouts wrapped the cutlery and put ribbons around it, the food was awesome and big portions and we got to take a plate and pie piece home.

However their heart is in the right place and they do the most they can with what they have. Too many times the homeless population that manage to Leach off taxpayers, and message all over our Fair City seem to be unappreciative of the effort put forth to feed them when I personally don't see it as my responsibility to feed other people's children, although I have raised none of my own only other people's children.

By far only 1 Manager was rude & unpleasant, Luckily she got fired so no more worries ;) Also always good food thanks to their two best cooks (you guys know who you are) It has its ups & downs. But when there its all about structure. So if your acting out of line and they call the cops on you it doesn't make anyone snitchs. Its called policy. I'm giving Hospitality House 4/5 Stars. My main reason of 4 instead of 5 is that they need to start testing everyone that comes in there and start monitoring those who sneak out past 9pm curfew. The favoritism needs to stop too. It's good to have favorites however business is business. Tracy knew that as a supervisor. Just cause he was friends with certain people. Doesn't mean you get to go out late at night and have fun, or smoke in the bathrooms, etc. Other than that the supervisors aren't the problem its the residents. I can say a lot of names, but i'll leave it there.",

This place is failing my cousin and whoever runs this place should have handled it and reassured my cousin when she went to the cops about this situation.

Did those monies come from a victims fund?\n\nWhat was worse was the message that thoughtless action sent which was \"you may be the victims, but we are the team\".\n\nI hope they rethink such activities in the future and think of the victims before themselves.\n\nAll I can do at this point is hope for the best, wait and see.\n\nI will be back to update this review when all is said and done."

            "Not a good shelter, they don't help with transportation to reunite you with loved ones if you ever get stranded in Chico, California. They would rather keep you there than to help with what you're needing/asking help with : leaving Chico. Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",

The staff are wonderful and have supported me the week. I have been here. I got an apartment so I will be leaving tomorrow so blessed that this place is here in our community to help out people who are in need. Big shout out to the staff!

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

            "I recently visited interfaith in Sonora,ca. A lady named Deborah informed me they could help me get a battery for my RV I just needed to bring a quote for the battery so I went to Napa Auto parts. Then returned to Deborah office whom upon my first visit stated that she to was once homeless so I thought she cared about me and my struggles since my of wife's  recent passing. 33years married to the love of my life. But thanks to living in toulomene county where most of the citizens are a product of in breading it really should come as no surprise to me that she is a liar and has no interest in truly helping anyone. So beware if you ever need help I would not recommend going to them for assistance. Thanks to Sargent passuqie (misspelled) touolueme county sheriff giving me a ticket for out of date registration. fine $160.00 which I just bought in January of 2024  and registration cost $785.00 the registration should not have been due until January of 2025. But thanks to the seller having lied about his wife having paid to keep vehicle on non-op. Again a citizen of toulomene countys (embreaded population) I am done with living in a society that has no compassion for anyone but them selfs,where lying is okay and the welfare system is a joke and if your a Senior Citizen in this county (good luck) because no one cares about you not even the ones displaying the cross that my Savior Jesus Christ died on as part of their business advertisement is all fake misleading which offers nothing more than creating a false sense of caring to for it's citizens. As for the Sargent for toulomene county again (my guess is a product of embreading) hello new State Law effective 2024 States it is illegal for officers to ticket a person for simply having expired tags for 60 days but on the start of the 90 day they can legally issue you a ticket the exception is if a driver has committed some other type of motor vehicle infraction can they issue a ticket.. know the law if your in a position of enforcing the laws.  Oh it's no superise that Debroah and The fine Sargent choose to profile the less fortunate by demonstrating what can happen when you are a product of embreading in toulomene county.  That's it I'm done you win have lived a fair life but I can't take it anymore so I'm going to say goodbye and pray for God's forgiveness for my selfish actions. Both Deborah \u00e0nd the good Sargent should not be in a position where they can cause people to loose hope and cause people to take their lives. Especially in positions where they have a duty to protect and serve the citizens (weather imbread or not) all people deserve better treatment no matter to their situation may be good luck and good bye oh I know who cares anyway right.",

            "Don't live here if ya wanna actually live.   It's like a animal exhibit more than anything.   We were kicked out when we were doing very well, then Betty tried to take it all away.  Kinda funny.\n\nNeed help? Aww poor thing, let me tease you with my wealth - betty\n\nBack in school Betty spoke about many things, and she was very uplifting.  But that was flushed down how she treated us.\n\nLike labrats\n\nThen out because I got a car, and Betty didnt like that !!",
            "I understand needing to impose restrictions, but Betty was mentally and physically abusive to me and others - kicking some people out randomly without discussing what they did wrong, while desperately helping her few select favorites. Severe abuse of power and resources. If you find yourself in this area and needing help, please go to the Mission or call for emergency help instead.",
            "Betty is as selfish and crooked as they come.  Her foundation is a joke and she lives high on the hog from the public's contributions while sharing the bare minimum with the people she's sworn to help. Treating them as poorly as some would treat a rat invading their sanctuary.",
            "This place should be called \"Betty Chinn Rules Enforcement Foundation\" because housing people takes a backseat to zero tolerance rules enforcement.  I didn't even break them, and they threw me out. Plus they refused my reasonable request for accommodation under ADA, and kicked me out for having the issue I was requesting accomodation for. After they threw me out I asked, in writing, if they'd let me use their toilets, and they ignored me. I am nobody to them. When I protested that they were throwing me out over their mistake and not mine, the attendant laughed at me and ridiculed me and started provoking me and got me worked up then started filming me and suggesting I get violent. I left screaming, then screamed and cried uncontrollably outside their gate for hours, and they never even so much as offered me a cup of water.\n\nThree stars because the rec room was nice and the portapotties were clean.",
            "Betty is the greatest. This location is her \"container village\". It is basically a bunch of shipping containers that have been converted into makeshift living space. Beats sleeping on the streets though, especially when it is raining. Located conveniently next to the Dept of Health and Human Services on Koster Street."

I was not familiar with people shooting drugs with port o potty water, or selling drugs out of port of potty\u2019s. But there\u2019s a first for everything. I am unsure of where Catholic Charities money is going. Because it certainly isn\u2019t helping those in need. It was brought to my attention on several occasions the staff is known for stealing the \u201cgood donations\u201d Pablo, Corina, Leslies, Cindy, Juanita, & Thalia . Are about the only staff members there who have empathy & genuine intent. Their rapid rehousing operation is a scam. Ask how I know. I got into it from Christina Atkins. Then thrown out 26 days later. They play dope fiend games. I don\u2019t know how this place is legal. Systematic oppression at its finest. You are a number. Not a human. And a dollar sign. THEE shadiest place I ever seen. A bike got stolen my first week. They will switch out bike tubings and steal parts to bikes. I didn\u2019t even know these kinds of petty thievery existed. Disregarding all the head banging from people nodding out on drugs in the bathroom. I forwarded a photo of the annex to a friend and was told \u201c I should go back to Mexico\u201d interesting what do you do if you are American citizen? There was a stabbing in the annex during my stay. They microwave raw meats. It\u2019s atrocious. They had to change the light colors in the bathrooms so people couldn\u2019t shoot dope anymore or see their veins. Merrika.",

I was so impressed with the staff and the beautiful space that they have created to help Sonoma County's Youth.\nThey have an overnight shelter and a day program which is open during the day to provide meals and a safe place to rest for Sonoma County youth. This is a great resource, especially for young people attending the Santa Rosa Junior College or nearby high schools.\nI asked about bringing other donations and they accept all kinds of donations! I brought food, but next time I'll stop by with backpacks, jackets, and things that teenagers would want.  :)\nIn addition to the day program, a home-like shelter is available for teens under the age of 18. Youth 18-26 (?) may go to the SAY Dream Center on the eastern outskirts of the city.\nI can't say enough good things about this.  Kudos to all the people who make this happen!",

They do absolutely nothing to provide the help people need. They just perpetuate the problems of this town. The workers were clients themselves, but where is the actual social work experience? They don't dispense soap for the bathroom, and people don't wash their hands, nor kids. Plus roaches, plus mold, and some staff member is allergic to bleach, so we're not allowed to use it at certain times. No wonder so many people were sick for weeks on end. They stopped accepting donations. You're treated like an idiot or a child at times. They let people scream and curse at their children. The rules are enforced depending on who is working. My case manager Jessica lied to me about giving me an extension of two weeks. She told staff that I was still leaving as scheduled and it caught me off guard. This place and its employees need an undercover to investigation. Please, please. See how this place is ran. You would be appalled. How does one report this place?",

            "This place is so wrong. And they lied to us. They took somebody a young man that worked hard to detox and then come to their center to get help. They accused him of all kinds of stuff the first night and they said he had to sleep in the basement with the homeless And drug addicts down below. They never really talk to him to find out what really happened. They just accused him. They told me they were a Christian based place. This does not sound Christian to me. I went and got him the night they told To sleep in the basement. They degraded him. They treated him like an animal, and he did nothing. I.Brought him home and now they\u2019re saying they saw him on the street sleeping on the ground getting up and acting funny the next morning and they\u2019re going by hearsay. Let me tell you this. This is the worst place you could send your child. He\u2019s been cut down so bad that I am concerned and worried about him and I blame it all on this place. Thank you so much for lying to me and my family and giving us hope for him. he\u2019s trying so hard to do everything right he was so happy to be there and you say it\u2019s mandatory that he sleeps in the basement for two weeks. There\u2019s something definitely wrong with this program that you would send someone down there with homeless people drug addicts and it\u2019s freezing cold. I\u2019m sending all this information to my attorney that my husband and I have had for years and we will just see how far you get with what you Have done to my son. I\u2019m pretty reasonable person, but I\u2019m not now not with you lying like you did if I could, I would name every single one of you that did this to him but I Can\u2019t if I\u2019m going to start a lawsuit against you.",

            "While I was here I seen a lot of people get kicked out.  They would lose their points fast if they have kids.  Most of the staff I loved.  Some of the staff picked on people just to make them loose their points so they would be kicked out.  I also was told I couldn't receive any help with finding a place for my daughter and I because I didn't make enough money at the time I was in disability.  I was told that I had to get a job or more income.  I feel that they could work on actually helping people who need and deserve the help.  I wasn't released to go back to work by several doctors and to be told that I wouldn't be helped because I was to low income really made me lose hope.  What was worse is I watched a family member of staff who was on drugs and bragged about using drugs qualify for help thru the programs available. This person also bragged about being a family member and that's why she got her rent paid for and utilities for several months.  I feel that haven of peace would do much better actually trying to help people get back on their feet.  I do however realize what the staff had to deal with on a daily basis.  Very ungrateful,  selfish,  uneducated,  lazy,  individuals.  People who just use the system and refuse to even try to do their chores or respect the rules.  I'm very grateful for even being able to stay for the month we got to stay for.  Furthermore,  my daughter and I will not forget several of the staff their that were exceptional people!! That's why I gave a 4 star rating.  I hope you improve on the few things I've mentioned.  Thank you.",
            "If you are ever without a home please never come to this place it will leave you with even more problems than just a home! My mother came here with my sister and my niece and they had to go to the hospital for dehydration and kidney infection. The reason why they got dehydrated was because they only handed out 1 water bottle a day (the average human needs 8 per day) and the owners never let outside food or drinks (I understand because they don't want more problems other than they're rat infestation but my mother wanted to bring water in and they didn't allow her to) and when the owners were going to throw away water that someone had donated my mother and her friend were trying to keep it but the owners forced her to put it back. The kidney infections they got were from the filth of this place. The kids were so poorly managed they they would rub their fecal matter along the wall and that gave the kidney infections to my mother my sister and to their friend. The owners were too busy \"praying to their god\" that they did not address to abuse the children were going through. My mother tried to tell the owners that the children were getting struck daily for no reason just to get their mothers anger out but the owner turned her back and said she needs to go pray to god first. Since the mothers (there were 4 of them) heard my mother telling the owner about their abuse to their own children, they threatened my 55 year old mothers, my 13 year old sisters and my 5 year old nieces lives and my sister even suffered a panic attack twice and had to go to the hospital due to her not being able to breath. They were scared to go back but they had to. When they did one of the kids who was 7 walked up to my mother with a heart on a piece of paper and apologized for her mothers actions and she said she understands the pain my family went through and said that her mother hurts her too but she needs to care for her 1 year old sibling since her mother won't and it honestly broke all of our hearts to see that she was so young and understood that she was going through verbal and physical abuse daily and when her mother  seen she had any drawing or school work her mother forced her to throw it away and said that she doesn't like \"bullshit\" like that around her and the owner turned her back to this kind of abuse and when the little girl couldn't keep her 1 year old sibling quiet she got hit and even when another kid who was 3 weeks old couldn't stop crying its mother would punch the child to shut up and no justice was brought to these children they are still going through this abuse daily and no one is doing any thing about it. The 4 mothers would constantly attack my family by using verbal abuse to her and to my sister and niece. When my mother tried to leave with my sister and niece they threw her stuff into bags and left it outside but kept all of their clothes. 3 out of the 4 mothers got kicked out but the owners never told the police about the abuse of the children so they still have their kids somewhere and they're probably get hit right now as I'm writing this and it disgusts me that these people get to walk away with their kids even when their kids are getting constantly abused. I hope no one comes here anymore and please if you need a home find somewhere different than here this is the worst place you could ever go to!"

            "Not a good shelter, they don't help with transportation to reunite you with loved ones if you ever get stranded in Chico, California. They would rather keep you there than to help with what you're needing/asking help with : leaving Chico. Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",

The staff are wonderful and have supported me the week. I have been here. I got an apartment so I will be leaving tomorrow so blessed that this place is here in our community to help out people who are in need. Big shout out to the staff! Chaz you were amazing thank you so much for being so kind and such a sweetheart! Chrissy, you were amazing Thank you so much for our beautiful Conversations\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ms.

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

I tried to explain that my friend isn't safe on the street because she is disabled and unable to defend herself or run away from any possible predators. The lady working told me that she didn't care, that check in time is only 3-5pm and to get off the property or she would call the cops.\n\nWe were not being loud. We drove into the property in a quiet little car, no music playing or anything. We called when we got there.

But I know my rights \u2013 I told them I don't consent to any illegal searches or seizures without a proper warrant. That's just basic legal stuff, right? They weren't pleased. It gets worse. I have a condition on my left foot that needs serious medical attention. But guess what? They actually ordered me not to dress my wounds or take the proper medical dosage as prescribed by my doctor. Then there's the matter of my diabetic medications too. They wanted them locked up because of kids around, which I was okay with, as long as my rights were reserved without prejudice. They intentionally altered with my medicine, medical treatments and seized my personal property without my consent or authorization. They didn't allow me to take the right doses of medicines or follow the doctor's orders for the treatment of my well-being and personal health.

I knew something was off, so I mentioned how they trustees/staff embezzling money and fraud they're involved in siphoning money through 4 different government agencies.

The amount of work, love, and patience that Ms Wilkins and Ms Barbara put in this place every day is magnificent.\nI came into this program with absolutely no life skills, no ambitions, no money, poor parenting skills, nasty eating habits, no communication skills and poor cleaning habits. I can full whole heartedly say that The staff at Mary\u2019s Haven help me step by step to change into a better person and a better mother. They put their heart and soul into this job. Helping those who are willing to make a change and still willing to help those who aren\u2019t quite ready by pushing them into the right direction. I can\u2019t forget to mention the love they have for each and every child that comes in with no hesitation. They make the children feel loved. My son absolutely loves all the staff here.

For the most part the staff are pretty nice there's a few that are iffy but your not gonna like everyone you meet.Our House can be a good placement it kinda depends on what kids are there cuz some of the kids I've seen them accept are CRAZY... Our House can also be very chaotic but like I said it depends on the kids they have at the time. Also the staff clean the house every day but it literally gets dirty again in the next 10 minutes cuz some of those children are nasty for real",

When I arrived I was greeted with a structured inviorment. And like 14 other boys. We went to alternative school, and did chores, lots of memories had a good friend go home on a home pass and never came back,  months later we found out he got shot in the head. The kid survived but was never the same, tht moment changed my life. I hope all theses fools who liked me or not are doing well. ,  yhe staff however , well let's just say there were not many good ones.  But we survived.     Oh uea this was a round late 1990's. Possibly mid 90's was a long time ago.",

I did not feel safe just picking up my son. The rooms were a mess and smelled like dirty clothes..",

            "Title: Mixed Experience at Time for Change Foundation\n\nI spent two weeks at Time for Change Foundation after completing a program at Cedar House Life-Changing Center. I initially felt inspired by the founder, Kim Carter, and her story of transformation and dedication to helping women rebuild their lives. The facilities were very clean, and some staff members, like Ms. Amy and Rosaline, were incredibly kind and professional.\n\nUnfortunately, my overall experience was not what I had hoped for. I was upfront about my situation and needs but quickly realized I might have been too advanced for their program. Constructive criticism should aim to build someone up, but I felt belittled and unsupported.\n\nAdditionally, some staff displayed unprofessional behavior, such as openly discussing private client matters in the presence of other clients. This lack of confidentiality is deeply concerning. While some staff members were helpful, others, like Sherika and crystal, seemed more focused on personal matters than on helping clients progress.\n\nIf you are already self-sufficient or seeking a program that emphasizes growth and respect, this may not be the best fit for you. It appears they prioritize clients who are more dependent, possibly to align with their funding model as a homeless shelter.\n\nI hope they address these issues to better serve the women who turn to them for help.",
            "To any women ( specifically women with children),  contemplating on bringing your family to Time For Change Foundation for assistance, please read this before making any final decision. I was a client here from February 2024 \u2013 June 2024 and I can honesty say they do not genuinely care about the woman or children in this program. All they care about is their appearance/ falsified reputation to the public to keep the donations/ funding coming in, and ignore the problems within their shelters, clients, and offices. My kids and I were wrongfully transitioned out of the program because the ladies I lived amongst did not like me, ( gossip,  immaturity, childish reasons), so therefore their solution was to get rid of me. I was 8 months pregnant with two young children ages 3 and 1. The director Ms. Vanessa informed me at 6 p.m. that I had to have all of our stuff packed, make sure I complete my chores in the morning, and be out by 9 a.m the next morning. Ms. Vanessa nor upper management  offered us any other alternative/ resources on another place to go. We were literally left to the streets. If it wasn\u2019t for my former case manager Ms. Christal who stayed up all night to make sure my family and I would have a roof over our head the next morning, I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to us. Time For Change accepts women into their program from all walks of life ( mentally ill, formerly incarcerated, recovering addicts) etc. and all of us come with issues. All women have to be evaluated at a mental health facility  while in the program. Though most women were prescribed medication, the women would not take their meds regularly resulting in mental breakdowns and cantankerous behavior. I was physically assaulted by another client at the shelter because my 3 year old apparently was crying to loud for her and she proceeded to get in my son\u2019s face yelling at him to stop crying.   On another occasion, My 3 year old was also physically assaulted while I was away at their office. When I returned, I asked the babysitter they hired what happened and she told me she didn\u2019t know! My son obtained deep scars on his face that are still present to this day.  I\u2019ve brought all these concerns to upper management and they never did a thing about it. They exploit women like us because they know that we are vulnerable and have no where else to turn for help.  Individuals who donate to them often come by the shelters to get a better sense of how we live. I specifically remember Ms. Phyllis ( upper management ) threatening us that if the house was not clean when the donors arrived we were \u201c going to get it\u201d.  My family and I  haven\u2019t been in the program for months and they are still to this day utilizing photos of my kids on their social media platforms to portray false narratives that are advantageous to their company. Time For Change Foundation has a beautiful mission statement and I believe at one point in time they had genuine dignity and pride in helping us. Now, it is tarnished by corrupt, money hungry, egocentric management/ employees that power trip and abuse their positions of power. To any women entering the shelters with your kids protect them \u2764\ufe0f.",
            "I\u2019ve been a client here since October 2022, which means I\u2019ve been here for 9 months. My story is just beginning but I\u2019ve had so much success since coming to this program. When I first got here, I came straight from jail four months pregnant. I had an open CPS case and though I didn\u2019t know it at the moment, CPS was waiting for me to give birth to open a case on my unborn child. While being reconnected to the rooms of narcotics anonymous and working my recovery, I took life changing classes provided by time for change such as job development, 12 step, life skills, financial literacy, and relapse prevention, it was able to mold me into not only self sufficiency, but I was able to find my confidence again, I was able to be equipped with tools that will help me for the rest of my life, I now realize I am worthy, and I love myself today. While being here i was also able to keep my baby (which is now 5 months now) and I also found a beautiful job which just might turn into a career in the future. Soon I\u2019ll find my own place and be self sufficient. They\u2019re main goal is self sufficiency but they provide so much more. They\u2019re a support system if you don\u2019t have one, they love you until you can love yourself, and motivate you and push you to reach your full potential. Thank you Time For Change for everything you have done for me.",
            "What can I say? I thought this place was only for women but there I was, by my lonesome, seeking hope in an unprecedented time. This place helped me plug back into who I was meant to be. I was down and out on my luck and I felt that the whole world was against me. But, Time for Change gave me a renewed hope. They believed that I could right my wrongs. Provided me positive mindset workshops. Empowered my family and I. They assisted me when there were so many doors closed. They believed in me especially when I doubted myself the most. Thank you, Liz. Thank you, Lisha. I could not have done it without your moral and financial support in all this. May you all who have the hope and pure love of Christ be enriched always.",
            "Bad experience at Time For Change Foundation. I was a client there for 6 months and I've witnessed a lot of unprofessional situations regarding the staff. I've also had a bad experience with the founder Kim Carter. These people are heartless, disrespectful, arrogant, inconsiderate, and non compassionate for their clients. They belittle you, talk to you like a child, judge you, and will kick you out whenever they please over the most ridiculous things.\nThey play with people's livelihood like it's the thing to do, I feel like over time they lost the passion for truly helping their clients move into self sufficiency. I was kicked out for telling them I feel like I'm not being helped enough and that turned into me being terminated from the program. They don't give you any notarization as to why you're being terminated that just kick you out like your garbage. I am back homeless with my son everything I was working hard for went down the drain because they don't care about their clients like they say they do we are nothing but a pay check to these people, which is quite sad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone especially if you have children because it's not what they say it is."

It's the perfect combination of program and freedom to help you get back on your feet without overwhelming you and making you feel like you went from residential to residential. You still have your freedom with some exceptions the classes aren't too much and their helpful It's understandable a place as good as this would have such a waiting list. There should be one of these in every city",

For a place that is supposedly trying to 'help' people, they are ridiculously intrusive on your privacy, as well as demeaning and disrespectful to you as a person. The vibe & atmosphere there feels very much like minimum security jail. Not the feeling one should have to experience when one is trying to move on and better their lives. A person named Tamara was the head when I was there; a very unfriendly and rude individual. I got the feeling that she does not like people of color, particularly black people. I understand we all have hard times & situations that may fall upon us, but I would definitely avoid this place like the plague if at all possible."

The cost of rentals here in Santa Maria are sky-high now and almost impossible for one person to make it. The staff here will help you find a place to call home. If they can't they will send you in the right direction. They are also helping me with insurance. Basically, I think of this place to get your life in order so you don't find yourself homeless again. Everyone has their own room here so if the world gets to be too much you have a spot to  unwind and get right. The staff are great here. Some rules are crazy but I feel privileged to be a pioneer and help show staff which rules are great and which aren't. We are all different so it can make for an interesting day.

            "I was placed into one of their programs, and my life changed for the better! Honestly, when I first got into their sober living home, I felt like I was in the middle of nowhere. However, I was so far removed from all of the snares and chaos of my life, that it was a relief. I didn't know anyone in Santa Maria, but was glad! I was connected to County services so I could get well, and back to work, and housed again (without a voucher too)! I just needed solid ground to get my footing. Long story short, when it rains, it pours! I experienced a whirlwind of unfortunate events during and after after the pandemic, to the extent I became unable to work, unable to cope, and needed help!\n\nThe entire staff was great! From my observation, if you treat the staff with respect, they will treat you with respect. If you follow their rules, things will become very easy for you. If you are honest with yourself and staff, things will become very easy for you! They are firm on their policy, as they should be, because they are dealing with lots of people, from various backgrounds. Rise up, to hold yourself accountable for your actions. The staff members at Good Samaritan evaluated my entire situation, and connected me to the services that are now paving the way for success, long after leaving sober living. I can't wait to get to my next destination in life, so I can give back just as soon as I can. I will never forget you all, and cherish Good Samaritan deeply.",

Case managers are even worse. Yolanda shows no professional attitude: she either acts as your best friend or talks to you like a middle school bully. Janie is useless and incompetent, and frequently issues notices to clients with incorrect or outdated information and typos. All of them make false promises on housing opportunities and show no sympathy when those promises fall through.

Of course there are things needing more attention and some things should change. I've been here since July and have seen the meals for breakfast and dinner get a lot better. The manager is working on finding someone to help with lunches and a place that can help us get our laundry done.

            "Ok, so if the majority of peeps read my posts you would have known I'm homeless living out of a tent, not by choice it was a loss of housing and then being scammed of $4500 in which I never got back. Instead of staying down in the dirt I stayed standing to continue rising up. So here I am at the San Diego Rescue Mission in Oceanside CA. I rated give stars bc it's a beautiful facility with awesome smiling eager to help you build staff. I will start with Kat she has a beautiful heart ND cares how u feel, then there's Kay she's very direct full of resources and gives u homework to ensure you are doing the foot work to build up. I mean why not?? If your not working u have plenty of time, right? Then there's James very humble cares about your needs and wants to help. Michael making sure us ladies keep our area clean and will give u fix it tickets to organize, yes! I got one but not bc I'm sloppy it's I did not have a 2nd bin they thought I had. that's just to name a few. In regards to residents ok to be honest the majority are sane neat and clean then u have your Insane that are, well u can fill that part in but the staff will do there best to ensure hygiene is priority ( Thank God :-). Beds and linens are cleaned weekly, beds are comfortable and floors, Wells and other areas are clean. At times if staff has suspicions they will follow thru with you and the area u sleep at. I know owner statement is a 30days shelter, well some residents have been given extensions for a 90days. This is a temporary housing facility and it doesn't mean u will move from here into a home of your own before your times up. It is possible IF YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK!! IF NOT, well guess what?? Your back on the streets maybe in a tent... I know that will not be me!!! So this is my story, you best believe I'm sticking to it. Have a good day with Blessings your way"

I was really scared to enter the facility from what I would see in the movies but when all family and friends could not help I was left with no choice. Once I got there the staff were so kind helping me with items and basic hygiene needs. I had 3kids with me  ages 12,10, and 3. They  loved the play ground and all the activities that were available to them. The rooms were safe and clean. The staff were beyond supportive and it just felt safe. The food was delicious. I highly recommend operation Hope to any mother, father or couple that is in need of shelter. Guadalupe was amazing to me and my kids with coming up with a plan to get out of the situation I was in. She was kind patient and soft spoken. She was gentle with her words when it came to things she thought was best even if I couldn\u2019t see it at the time.

The way it works is you put in the work you make a lot of sacrifices and you dedicate your life to have a better life! My son and I loved it here and everyone including residents all loved my son. My advice to anyone that really truly wants a better life for themselves or for their children is to come in all the way BE PATIENT AND OF COURSE BE HUMBLE it doesn\u2019t happen over night it takes time and if you really want something and want the help you have to do some things you don\u2019t want to.

            "From my personal experience ive been getting worse staying here both mentally and physically than when i was out sleeping under a bridge. Seemed pretty helpful at first but its caused nothing but more stress and their way of handling problems between clients and staff have made things harder on myself and TONS of other clients ive spoken to. I hang around with more than 10+ clients daily and listen to at a few everyday rant to me (or witness myself) about something the ync failed to do. Ik some staff sleep w clients. When problems occur they are so quick to shut u down or kick you out if u ask to speak w a higher up. Or will kick u out without getting to the bottom of situations and take one persons side. Sometimes depending on the staff handling the situation theyll pick sides of the person depending on their race or gender. I am very hesitant when going to staff about my own problems w other clients because of how i seen them deal with others with the same problem as mine. Lots of staff are very rude and disrespectful for no reason. I spent my first few days there keeping my head down and VERY quiet but still had staff speak to me like i was a problematic child. Allegedly some staff have not had PROPER training? I can tell u for a fact every time ppl argue with staff its cause the staff made a snarky/rude comment first. They are very sensitive and need to realize they are working with YOUTH and speaking to CLIENTS. We are in need of a place to stay and our mental is horrible\u2026 the last thing we need when we think we finally found a place we can feel comfortable and safe at is the constant disrespect and lack of care. But they make good food so whatever right?\n\nso many people ik in the shelter came there sober/clean and end up relapsing or getting worse bc they cant deal w the bs\n\n(3rd time reposting cause it got deleted but I\u2019ll continue to repost till they actually change or talk to me \u263a\ufe0f i think some people should know what actually to expect staying here)",

            "As old as this building is, this organization probably does the most in the city as far as what they have to offer, but they always get bashed because they are Christian organization. So of course everybody has an opinion of what Christians should be doing or how they should be conducting business. But don't know any other place that offers a homeless shelter a day center, a nightly Christian service, a hot meal, food bags, clothing, hygiene kits, celebrate recovery, a sober living program, and a transitional housing program. And they also work with CDCR and Geo called to stop program and yet they get very little money from the city, county, state or federal if any at all. It's all generated by the services they provide to other facilities and/or through donations",
            "I give Victory Mission 3 stars because what do you expect from a gospel homeless shelter. They provide a clean, safe, welcoming place to stay and a decent meal, and offer Bible based recovery programs for the men who seek shelter there. They need the city's help, but there isn't much coming, so they do it on their own. Come on Salinas, let's all pitch in !",
            "They charge $5 per night to get in, and management steals your bank card and ID, and they kick people out over every little thing, and they call the cops and have them beat you up. And they'll falsly accuse you with the intention of getting you put in jail.",
            "1st, the lead picture is misleading and not accurate, probably from not updating their page. I stayed their 5 months last winter from being homeless for the first time, and would not ever stay at Victory Mission again. The location and the old building are undesirable is an understatement and both are unhealthy in all ways."

I've always said, it takes a Village to assist with a crisis, and they were that Village that came to my rescue. Notwithstanding, thank you Mrs. Kay for being a conduit that lead to Mrs. Kimberly P. and Mrs. Liz V., because without their tenacious spirit and incessant drive, I would not have been approved for assistance.

How are they helpful to me?? Really. Thank you but much improvement is needed. And the janitor is an absolute dirtbag bully. He turns up on all kinds of people and bully's all kinds of clients. It's racism and he should be kicked to the curb. He does it to all kinds of people. A lot. Than the staff has his back when he is way wrong. He is destroying people's lives ( not mine I'm always good) but others yes. It's complete racism someone needs to look into it it's sick. And I've heard from staff that they have let people die there on purpose. I don't know if that's true but the staff said it and i think that's morbid. I love helping people so when people who are supposed too do like that it makes me vomit in my mouth. Sick. Janitors a dirtbag needs reprimand.

It's a process to get in (you need to take a TB test then orientation) but I had a bed and breakfast for the next 6 months while I went to school and they refer me to another program that got me an apartment for $50 a month!\nI've been in my own place for 4 years! All I have to do is just let them visit me for 5 minutes every month and that's only to check up on me to see if I need anything like a haircut voucher or a box of food.\nThe only thing is that the curfew is at 7:30pm and you have to leave after breakfast (which is 7:30pm, if I remember right), unless you work or go to school. If you're on drugs then you probably won't make it, even with those simple rules (from what I saw). But if you're serious about getting on your feet and getting some stability, then St. Vincent is the perfect place for you!\nShout out to my caseworker Sharen Cervantes!

They give zero cares about people in need. I signed up to get help with keeping me in my place! I\u2019ve STILL!! Never heard back from my worker! Or her supervisor! It\u2019s been WELL! Over a month! I was given an appointment  to come back to bring two forms that they never told me I needed before hand! Only once I got there. However, I brought back the next week at the day and time I was given! Guess what! I sat there from 10:00 that morning until1pm!! ! Not my \u201cworker\u201d or anyone else  for that matter ever! Came out to see me. So I of course left!! Only for me to call back a few hours later to THEN!! Be told that she actually had NEVER!! Even came to work that day!! So I sat all that time for nothing!! Like  No one knew this?? Not even the front desk? Really!?!? Then when I was finally given her number, So  called, called several times,  leaving several messages! Was very polite and professional! Yet! She still has never called me back. Till this day!! Also the days I had come in looking and hoping for help! Person  after the person!  Would come in, go to the window and tell the same type of stories to the woman at the front desk! How they had been waiting for weeks to hear back about one thing or another! Or how their landlord has been waiting on something that was supposed to have been handled and how it\u2019s been over 3/4 weeks of calling and coming by with nothing! And these women at the window NEVER!!! Seems to know ANYTHING!! I watched this happen hour! After hour! Same stories. These people do not care about anything but getting a check! And as long as they have no one to check them!! Hold them Accountable!! They will continue to do the same thing which is nothing!!! And  get paid for it! It is the worst organization I\u2019ve ever walked into. It\u2019s the  people who are truly in need that is suffering because of it. Because if their supervisors continue being busy only being their friends instead of a true leader! Then they will never change this behavior. I still have never met my worker. I\u2019ve still never spoken to my worker! Only the \u201cintake worker\u201d. However, I\u2019ve left messages after messages after messages. No return phone calls,  no letters, just  no care at all for the Crisis in front of them. . I\u2019ve explained to her over the phone Just how pressing my situation is! And  Absolutely nothing.  I mean It must be nice to get a paycheck just to simply clock in!  And I\u2019m sure every one of them! In their interviews talked about how they love helping people.\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m sure they either started or ended with that LIE!!! HOPICS! Is not for the people!! It\u2019s where they all come and gather! Hang out with their coworkers! And get paid. I seen and heard SOOOOO! Much more then! But I honestly can\u2019t tell it all here. Only if someone of authority would call me!! I would LOVE!! To tell them everything I\u2019ve seen and heard! Even from others I know personally. HOPICS!! Is HORRIBLE!! And it\u2019s unfortunate. They don\u2019t even realize or care to that it\u2019s because of the people in need that they even have this program/job. They win though. We lose. The ones that has been helped!

How are they helpful to me?? Really. Thank you but much improvement is needed. And the janitor is an absolute dirtbag bully. He turns up on all kinds of people and bully's all kinds of clients. It's racism and he should be kicked to the curb. He does it to all kinds of people. A lot. Than the staff has his back when he is way wrong. He is destroying people's lives ( not mine I'm always good) but others yes. It's complete racism someone needs to look into it it's sick. And I've heard from staff that they have let people die there on purpose. I don't know if that's true but the staff said it and i think that's morbid. I love helping people so when people who are supposed too do like that it makes me vomit in my mouth. Sick. Janitors a dirtbag needs reprimand. Also he calls people out to fight than calls the cops and kicks them out like i said sick.",

Timing couldn't be any better the Hartman house was opening within weeks. I was there roughly two months and during that time I was shown their compassion and caring I needed during that time. I'm forever grateful for the help they gave me. Clean and peaceful atmosphere and if you happen to be blessed with the opportunity to stay there, I would recommend that you embrace it with all your ability. Thank you Pathways to Housing.",
            "This newly established facility is tremendous. After being involved in an accident and unable to work or provide for myself temporarily, this facility opened it's doors to me, to help me.\n\nThere is a doctor, psyche, case manager, and other resources on-site weekly. Generally, meals are provided otherwise it is relatively independent living. Males and Females are housed in separate, clean, accommodating, dorm-type living arrangements. Appliances on sight to help with clean apparel, which if you are lacking, can also be provided from local donations.\n\nA swift, safe, comfortable, and pleasant recovery from my accident was a blessing that I believe many people could also benefit from. The staff is wonderful and goes above and beyond every day to ensure the clients are happy.\n\nShasta Community Health Center/H.O.P.E provides the medical portion for patients while Pathways To Housing leads with the housing/facilities. Both are reputable organizations and if they offer you a referral, it will doubtless aide your situation. A gem of the community!",

I do come into contact very regularly with many of the homeless people in Redding and who passed through Redding. It's just kind of funny because almost every one of them who's been around a while has made use of the beneficence found at the mission but on the other hand they quickly move into all the negative things they can think of. Mostly and I hate to say it, it is just a lot of victim mentality and entitlements spirits working and the mission doesn't fulfill all of their desires so they end up being ingrates.\nI don't remember but I think it's been pushing 60 years since the mission has been here helping people. Come on! Only God does stuff like that."

I mentioned the Hi Jolly big camel mosaic. \"Unique collection,\" The Getty Museum. I have some resources and have gotten a lot of media attention. For more images, see my somewhat redundant Pinterest boards. I also have a large Critter Collection, 45 pieces?, some big! Thanks to everyone's hard work. Best, Farrell  I only sold a couple eggs, the first at the old Miramar in Montecito, CA,  One sold at a benefit for a food bank here for $1,250, so, if HOWA came up with a buyer in that range, they could sell one and keep all the money. The White House sent my wife one of their autographed, wooden Easter egg roll eggs. It was quite a surprise. Thanks again! The quote is from my upbeat novel. I had a writer's file with The Tonight Show back in the day!",
            "Attended a many virtual meetups over 4 yeara and 3 in person gatherings. Over time this group is shrinking. In my opinion, between the control freak they hired to monitor the virtual meetups and the cliques they've formed, repelling every newbie or anyone who isn't already established, it was a depressing abusive experience. They publish their virtues and list a litany of things they claim they believe in, but they help very few.  They talk but rarely execute their plan. I came alone and after 4 years I left alone. There is -no- community. There are only closed little groups that ensure no one else gets in. I wanted to have travel buddies while I looked for property to buy. My neighbor is coming with me. If you'd like companionship \"Community,\" join a club on meetup that shares your interests. HOWA can only depress you and make you feel unwanted. No one deserves that.\ud83d\udc95",

I have been using some of the resources they offer, mainly the virtual caravans and information on Utube. They are some of the most generous, helpful and good hearted people I have ever met. Their philosophy of inclusion and non judgment while still providing a safe space is admirable.\nA wonderful resource for those wishing to learn more about the nomadic lifestyle and connect with others who have that interest.\nThey are trying to help people who are falling through the cracks in our social safety net, people whose income is not enough to pay for housing and who are on the edge of homelessness.",

Delicious meals and a comfy bed. I was not able to get assistance with visitation. I was informed to reach out to another agency. A few of the women were kind and friendly. You have to take a drug test when asked.  I am not sure how benzos came up on my test. I am involved in a legal matter. Being under the influence is not going to help me when I am fighting to get my daughter back. Hopefully everyone gets the help that they need.",

            "I was so grateful to stay here! I got out of an abusive marriage and didn't have anywhere to go. It was during COVID when everything was crazy. You had to do what they asked (keep everything clean, get a job, get all the things you need to get welfare and housing) which was a breeze after what we went though. I only stayed a month, but the first night we were there they found out it was my daughter's birthday the day before and they threw a birthday party at the last minute. My daughter was so happy. They also added a snack in between breakfast and lunch because my kids and the other family that moved in would get hungry in between breakfast and lunch while we were there. They let us visit when my dad came from out of state as well. I also loved the room set up and the bedding. They had a TV and toys and books in the living room.  I stayed friends with some of the people I met there before moving to Coachella Valley and getting my own place in Palm Springs.",
            "If you are lazy or don't want to improve your situation, just don't come. This place is the only shelter in the county that let my family stay together. We have our own, private room. There's an individualized case plan for each intake and they truly care to help you leave here better than you came in. I love it here.",
            "This place is horrible that lady Cheryl treated me and my family horribly my son got food poisoning and couldn't eat for several days and she told me I couldn't make him anything different because it wasn't fair to the other families so my son went hungry for 2 days cause we weren't aloud to give him anything different. Also the local Walmart donates soaps and good for the families and Cheryl would pick and chose of what she wanted and would leave the things she didn't want for the families. I was told that I was living a lavish lifestyle I couldn't afford and was told I shouldn't have the car I had if I was homeless but let's not forget people don't chose to be homeless it just happens sometimes I was told if I didn't have to be there then why was I SMH it was a horrible stay but let me tell you ALEX she was amazing she's the sweetest most loving person in that entire shelter she helped me get thru alot of those hard days and stressful nights at that horrible place she made it easy to be there when she was working. This so called religion based place isn't so holy when you see the movement behind those closed doors they discriminate and make you feel like a low life good for nothing person... and it's like you can never catch a break in that place I would NEVER recommend this stay to anyone it was a nightmare. The only good thing that I got out of this place was the friendships I found with some of the families I met but other than that it's  true what one of the other comments said they will lie,decive and  do what they can to keep other people in and kick others out it's crazy if I ever were to hit hard times like that again I would definitely be better off staying in my car for sure but thank the good lord those extremely stressful nights and long days are past us now. If I could just put a zero star I would.",

            "I was here with my special needs son in 2020. We were not given any help and no matter how many list we got on for transitional housing we were always called back saying that we were denied due to my son's disability they told us that because of his condition and he hit other kids they could not give us housing. People who had children with autism or targeted, a lady was made to go outside and sleep in her car because her child was special needs was nocturnal which is common with a lot of children with special needs she was also threatened with CPS even though she had done absolutely nothing to her child. I was also threatened with CPS and that was another reason why I did not feel safe there apart from the neighborhood also being unsafe and all the shootings that were going on while I was there I felt very insane. Staff screened at us verbally abused me and my son. I also witnessed a lady that had twins and when she got to the shelter she had nothing this was during the pandemic so even though there was a places for people would come through domestic violence they couldn't get into those places because of the pandemic and the restrictions that it caused. This lady asked the staff if they could help her get diapers to which they responded that she would have to buy some. They also made us sign up for things like tablets but they were never given to us they were never delivered to us they were never basically given to us by the staff. I also witnessed staff receiving donations of clothing but not actually giving that clothing to the people that were at the homeless shelter I witness them loading it into the back of their cars and taking it with them. And I also witnessed the same exact thing with the towels and the blankets that were given for the homeless people they would take them home with them in the back of their cars put it in their trunk. We were highly discriminated against simply because we were light skinned, even though I am Hispanic I was discriminated against by these people who were African American. I had never experienced something like this and it was absolutely the most horrible experience I've ever had I left the homeless shelter and found a room to live in which I was very grateful for because that's why I had come to the homeless shelter to try to find housing and they were of no help whatsoever in fact they would tell the transitional housing places that my son was too difficult in that they should not take me and my son. I experienced a lot of racism simply because I was Hispanic and I was experiencing that from Caucasian social workers as well as African-American social workers. The experience was absolutely horrible eye opening and I don't wish it on anybody.",

When I pulled up I watched by the manager Steve closely he watched my every move, I never left my car and the person came downstairs to pick up somethings from me. After I left the tenant was written up and reprimanded for my 7 minute visit. Next Move should be there to assist their tenants and not harass them. They all come from different situations and circumstances, some out of their control. Perhaps the Directors, Board of Chairman\u2019s and whoever else is in charge should come and talk to their tenants one on one to see what is really happening at Next Move.

Kinda funny.\n\nNeed help? Aww poor thing, let me tease you with my wealth - betty\n\nBack in school Betty spoke about many things, and she was very uplifting.  But that was flushed down how she treated us.\n\nLike labrats\n\nThen out because I got a car, and Betty didnt like that !!",
            "I understand needing to impose restrictions, but Betty was mentally and physically abusive to me and others - kicking some people out randomly without discussing what they did wrong, while desperately helping her few select favorites. Severe abuse of power and resources. If you find yourself in this area and needing help, please go to the Mission or call for emergency help instead.",

I didn't even break them, and they threw me out. Plus they refused my reasonable request for accommodation under ADA, and kicked me out for having the issue I was requesting accomodation for. After they threw me out I asked, in writing, if they'd let me use their toilets, and they ignored me. I am nobody to them. When I protested that they were throwing me out over their mistake and not mine, the attendant laughed at me and ridiculed me and started provoking me and got me worked up then started filming me and suggesting I get violent. I left screaming, then screamed and cried uncontrollably outside their gate for hours, and they never even so much as offered me a cup of water.\n\nThree stars because the rec room was nice and the portapotties were clean.",

There is a staff members lie, abuse, disrespectful attitudes, and many more about them. The case managers do not help at all either. Case managers are disrespectful and do not care about kids mental health and many more. The St Mary\u2019s cafeteria is disgusting they have expired food and drinks.\nI have seen apple juice from year 2024 December 1st and also they put some type of medicine in the water. St Mary\u2019s does not let you get stuff done. They have all these meetings around like in the morning and afternoon. This place adds more and more rules everyday. The showers are disgusting and the bathrooms are not cleaned. The people who live here have to clean it. Kids cannot even stay home if they\u2019re sick. This place is not what you think it is. The case managers do not want you to tell the cops or anyone how they treat people here. They abuse children and adults. They treat us like robots or slaves. They is way more where that came from to. Kids can\u2019t cry when they\u2019re hurt or overwhelmed. Staff and admin do room checks and tell us to downsize. They told me to get rid of my clothes and hygiene items and also toys. Kids cannot play here at all. When you do delivery\u2019s you have to go up to the front gate and do not send them in the back even if you are pregnant or sick.

            "Please look for another adoption agency if you are looking for dogs. I believe that the woman that runs the dog adoptions is fraudulently taking money from people. Her name is Jennifer Anderson. Everything that she told us was incorrect. The adoption fee of $350 included the chip (that she gave to us in a baggy), first puppy shots and $100 to be refunded when we showed proof of neuter. She spoke at length  about how important it was to neuter at roughly 6 months, because of hormones and growth. Also, Ms. Anderson was very aggressive in her request that we make out own dog food. To the point that I thought she wouldnt let us adopt if we didnt agree with the request. When we took our new puppy to our vet, we found out that he already had a chip, and they strongly requested that we NOT make our own food unless we're consulting with a dog nutritionist. 6 months go by and we're patiently waiting for our puppy's balls to drop and surprisingly they never did. After contact with Ms. Anderson 7 months later, she said that she had forgotten and our puppy had already been neutered. That's kind of a big forget. She also told me not to listen to my vet about dog nutrition. She had done the \"research\" and she knew better. It should be noted that Ms. Anderson is not a veterinarian, but she is a moron. I encourage Alturas to find another person to run their dog adoptions."

My experience with TEACH prior to this has been fairly good, the thrift store is excellent and everything moves smoothly in the food line, but trying to actually apply for something seems to be very difficult for some and no problem at all for others. This is disappointing, and I hope to hear from someone soon, given that I heat my home with a woodstove and have been getting along by the kindness of a friend's friends.

They don't care who you are or what your past is they just want to provide the youth and teens with safe housing, food to eat, showers, and even help with providing a plan to get out of the situation that made you homeless. They want to see you grow and learn to become a responsible adult and will provide what you need to complete that goal. They support you and are there for you through everything and make it known you always have a safe place to go. Hearts and safe families helped bring my family back together and not only helped me but also my mom with her addiction habits and reached out to her as well. If you need a safe place to go and focus on yourself and your needs, and not worry about simply surviving or housing, I strongly recommend HWAM."

There are no other means to pay.for assistance.\n\nCAP has come to our rescue, we have been with them a few years and had help with roof that had been leaking.  We had gone two winters without a heater until CAP replaced.  We got a new refrigerator, new shower heads, fire alarm, lighting, a new back door and new kitchen and bathroom floor repair due to water damage.  Just last week, our main bathroom floor was more severely damaged than when we first got the report.  Our bathroom floor looks brand new, what a fantastic job the CAP team did!\n\nWe just wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford all those repairs and appliance purchases.\n\nWe were blessed beyond anything imagined and wish we could compensate the organization.  They work with funding issues and they worked hard for our case.  Saying thank you just doesn\u2019t seem enough of what we have in our \u2665\ufe0f hearts.  Dell had stood out, we got to see him the most. He was a joy to have him return.   We were educated and never made to feel  guilt or shame for needing their services.  And knowing that others may have not gotten their needs met due to funding and all the work they helped us with.  The team every time were so kind and professional.\n\nGod love you all and if I was a fairy with a magic wand, all your needs would be met and to each of you who participated in our projects, you\u2019d be heading to Vegas and the first machine you select would be sprinkled with fairy dust!

            "Stay the night for free up to 30 days: you get a mat and a sheet, sometimes a pillow and blanket.

Last I heard it was 6pm but when I got there, everyone had already eaten dinner and there was none left.  So I think it's dinner at 5:30pm and worship / Bible at 6pm then ice cream after 7pm (after the sermon ends).\nSunday: out by 6:30am and wander Susanville until about 6:30pm; dinner most Sundays at about 7pm.\n\nCoffee Monday through Friday all day (except when they kick you out and lock the door)\n\nStaff:\nDaniel brings it all day.

            "Great people! Kind hearts! If you are in need they will try there best to help you and say prayer with you. They offer meal every once in awhile and a food bag if hungry, they have even given me diapers before because I literally didn't know what to do and had no way to diaper my child for a week and gave my 2 older kids a jacket when we first moved here because we didn't expect it to be as cold as it was. Thank you for helping the community when they need it!",
            "This is a self-help based, peer-staffed oasis of recovery. They offer many services, from shelter and food etc. for those experiencing homelessness, to education and counseling for a variety of personal problems. The staff and the program participants are all friendly and helpful.",
            "We were told we could stay there and look for a place to stay and there was no time limit. Within 2.5 weeks, we were told we could stay 30 days. When we asked how we are supposed to save up a minimum of 1500 dollars in thirty days to cover move in costs, we were told to get a rental agreement. We agreed. My wife is in the hospital, facing gallbladder surgery, and we called and told Susan, their director what was up, the only thing she gave a damn about was that stupid rental agreement, and not a tinkers damn about the fact my wife was facing a high risk operation. There really needs to be an inspector to go in and see their habits in food preparation, and how it's served. No gloves,T or hair nets. That troll that works in the kitchen, ( Terry), who is mean and always puts her nose where it does not belong needs to find another line of work. She has proven to be anything except a Christian. She sent my wife on a wild goose chase after ordering me to not park in their parking lot, and when I confronted her, she smirked. Never once was I ever so tempted to hit a woman! I truly believe this place should be either more closely monitored, or shut down."

I think because my four kids are in that age range currently it really tugs at my heart strings to see these kids who didn\u2019t/don\u2019t have the family support and are now connected to people and resources who are helping them stay warm and fed so they can also get healthy and learn new skills. Please check it out and find out ways that you can help if you are able to.",

I'm thankful that there is a program like this for people my age because it really was a blessing. God Bless everyone who works there and the people who made/make it happen.",

The staff here treat you like your IQ is less than of an infant and inforce rules that are unethical. The residents here are unbelievably senseless and irresponsible and small minded ppl.and the worse part is being locked out of the dorms all day including the heat.most ppl who can't be in the heat due to medical conditios stay lock from 1pm- 3pn  Everything there is unorganized and no one follows the rules kids unsupervised all the time and. In. My defense I have a past here and I know more than anyone that place needs to be thoroughly looked at this place isn't what they make it out to seem a happy and go lucky place when it's a disaster behind closed doors.

            "If you are motivated self-sufficient, trying to find permanent housing, and just in need of a safe place to get on your feet. This is not the place for you. They bring you under the guise that it is a homeless shelter, they first tell you your paying for shelter fees and that they want a 3 month commitment $650 a month for single bed in a shared room then once you sign you are told you are paying for \u201c the program\u201d no one is paying the same amount almost like they charge what they want to charge that moment but in reality \u201cthe program \u201c is being enforced by other homeless residents who can be found in their spare time panhandling at the local grocery store. They are taken advantage of women in need and most of the positive reviews are the favored residents and friends of the director I have filed reports with dhcs/dfeh THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HOMELESS WHOM THEY KNOW HAVE VERY LITTLE OPTIONS IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TAKE THEM THIS \u201cprogram\u201d is a set up",
            "The place is infested with mice and roaches!!! The directors refuse to call pest control all they do is bomb and put down boric acid which obviously is NOT working. boric acid is extremely poisonous and there are a lot of young children living there which is concerning. It\u2019s $400 for you and $100 per child. Some residents were paying over $800 to live in filth with bugs and rodents. It\u2019s extremely sad. Me and my child were sick our entire time at love a child, we didn\u2019t get better until we left. I had to take my child to the emergency room because a roach was stuck in their ear and my child was admitted and had to be treated for an infection with antibiotic's. The director dismissed me from the program because I had to stay overnight in the hospital with my child but honestly I was relieved because I did not want to return! They threatened to throw all of my belongings away if I did not retrieve by the end of the day. They wrote me up for missing church although I provided them a doctor\u2019s note stating that me and my child were sick. I constantly got written up because the rules are unclear and certain rules only apply to certain residents. The staff are residents but they get away with things that other residents get written up for. They\u2019re allowed to let their children play outside unattended with no shoes or proper clothes on but if another resident does that they are written up. The staff residents will literally write you up for anything just because they can. This program is obviously taking advantage of vulnerable women with children. Staff residents are obvious drug users but directors do not care. They do not drug test you upon acceptance into the program so they basically let anyone in. They say that they do random drug tests but the residents I talked to on a daily basis while I was there said they had never been drug tested during their time there. One resident even bragged about leaving to go smoke Meth. They do not provide any housing resources! They do not do case management! All they do is take your money and give you a bunk bed in a filthy cottage ingested with roaches and mice. BEWARE",
            "I was fleeing domestic violence, my abuser is actively searching for me. I was dismissed from the program for being in the main office at 7pm.\n\nI was a late intake the day previously and had support with my domestic violence advocate. I was extremely tired and didn\u2019t catch all of the information. I figured I would find out more the next day. I went to sleep, left the property early on the morning- before 645a to get to work. The website says that they help with transportation to work, THEY DONT. It took me 3 hours to get to work via bus and BART for a 3 hour shift, and another 2-3 hours to get back. I was gone all day.\n\nI called the program prior to arriving, letting them know I was gone at work and making my way back. I arrived back to the property around 645p and entered the office.  I went in to ask questions about the program, how to fill out my schedule, and what I needed to do for classes, etc. I left quite early in the morning and knew I missed information so I was just asking for tips.\n\nI am not familiar with Pittsburg at all and wanted to know more about the are, how to get around, advice and things like that. As I was talking to the woman, we talked about God, my journey, etc. I felt so much better. All of a sudden a woman named Courtney whom I have never met before or seen before came in to say that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be in there. She spoke to the woman as if I were not there and said something along the lines of \u201cyou can\u2019t let these people in here just tell them no. I saw the camera.\u201d It was extremely rude and unwelcoming and I calmly explained that I was a new intake, and wanted to know more information and I took it upon myself to come in and ask what the requirements were, what I missed, classes.\n\nThe woman, Courtney said I needed to leave and could finish tomorrow. She then started speaking down to the new employee. This new employee is part of their work adjustment program and only made $10 for the WHOLE 8 hour shift. I calmly explained again to Courtney that this woman was just trying to help. I\u2019m fleeing domestic violence and I\u2019m in an unfamiliar area. Courtney said someone would call me and explain. I don\u2019t believe that because nobody called me that day, I actually called in twice, and nobody knew who I was.\n\nI explained to Courtney that I didn\u2019t appreciate her tone and asked how they would get ahold of me since they failed to do so\u2026 and she quickly glanced at my work schedule and was like \u201cwe can have an appointment with you on Tuesday at 130p. I said that\u2019s fine but I want my DV advocate there. As I\u2019m trying to pack up to leave, she says, that Love a Child has no gates and I\u2019m free to leave whenever I want. I explained that that was not what I wanted and I was grateful to be there.\n\nI told her I wasn\u2019t feeling comfortable talking to her, explained I had a social work background, and legal background. She asked what does it have to do with the conversation. I explained that she was escalating the situation, I have PTSD. She got visibly upset, and said I was being insubordinate and I was dismissed from the program. I asked her to please call my advocate and that any discussions and decisions need to be made by her as my PTSD symptoms were exacerbated by her.\n\nShe proceeded to cal police and told them I was there refusing to leave property. I said alright thank you, please call my advocate. They could not get in touch with my advocate.\n\nAs I was walking back to my unit (where I had only been there one night), she approached me saying I was free to pack my stuff. I was already going to grab my stuff, what was the point of her approaching me like that? To exacerbate my symptoms even MORE?\n\nApparently Courtney goes to Bay Church Concord, I also attend there. I\u2019m so disappointed in how she handled the situation. This is not how a Christian behaves. I slept on the street last night. Had nothing with me and it was 50 degrees last night.\nIsaiah 54:17 is what gets me through. But I am so sad and hurt by the lack of support especially female support.",
            "Tbh I had the worst experience i was in the hospital take to mind I was pregnant they called me the next day after I delivered my baby that if I didn\u2019t pay my program fees I would lose my bed I had no where else to go I had my 2 kids my oldest 8 my middle 6 and my newborn they had no sympathy for what I was going through. This program lacks compaction and respect for there residents and the office needs lots of work Shannon needs to get out the office and Courtney needs to open her eyes. I am thankful but living at love a child shouldn\u2019t b hard like they make it.",
            "I didn\u2019t get the chance to stay here. But I did go through the application process . This shelter charges $450 for a single person to stay in a bed with also a $50 intake fee. This is a lot for someone who has zero income. They said that they would help even if you could not pay . But for me there\u2019s too many requirements that made my decision about staying here. One requirement that surprised me is that If your dr has prescribed meds to you, you have to be on them to come into this program. Which was a no for me because I was in the process of changing drs & the medication she had me on induced diabetes so I had to stop taking them. If you want to be in this program you have to take all meds prescribed by your doctor no excuses. I would not recommend based off how much you have to pay just to be provided a bed."

            "Calli house is a good place to lay your head if you are homeless as a youth as i stay here right now but it is bad thay tell you to get a job but dont give you the proper tools to help you out but u might have a better chance in prison"

            "NOT for families,women or children they cater to people who need rehabilitation which your environment will be filled with people who are still fighting substance abuse.they kick the women and children out early morning,which is what help if you have a baby? Or If you\u2019re pumping and or need to store breast milk I wouldn\u2019t recommend unless a single individual who needs a bed at night bc you won\u2019t be able to gather yourself it\u2019s a cycle of not getting yourself together and living at a shelter.which is never the goal",
            "This is only a place to come if you REALLY have no where to go. The staff does not care about the people who stay in the shelter and they are rude as hell. The main draw they use is being Christian based. Well, if this is a Christian based program and this is how Christians are I want NOTHING to do with the religion.",
            "They kicked out someone working for me in a different city just cause she wouldn\u2019t be back by the curfew, and she has 2 small babies. Lady on the phone was very rude. I would give this place 0 stars.",
            "This place is not for the people and will kick you out based on popularity contest there was only two staff members in particular who were a real Christian, real women of God and who truly loved doing thier job with love and care and thier name was Lealie and Tina. But other than that the other staff members play favorites they don't supply the shelter guest with the proper things that they need they harbor most of the things that are donated and give the donated items to the guest that they like. I wouldn't recommend this place to any woman going through real trauma as I was going through real trauma and I was mistreated and bullied out of the facility when I truly needed to help I followed everyone to a tea I kept my room clean I cleaned like a mad woman and I still was bullied and put out of the facility for no reason at all",
            "I volunteer there. It's a great place for people going through hardships of different sorts. It's in a tough area and is a beacon of hope for many people caught in the turmoil of life's ups and downs. They serve over 60,000 meal's per month to people who are really in desperate situations. They take in people who don't have anywhere else to go and they offer a program and educational tools to the folks who apply themselves. It's a Worthy cause for your donations, the money goes to good use."

They would rather keep you there than to help with what you're needing/asking help with : leaving Chico. Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",

I got an apartment so I will be leaving tomorrow so blessed that this place is here in our community to help out people who are in need. Big shout out to the staff!

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

I just came back from the V.A and we are headed home to my house .  please be cautious if you walk pass this place it is dangerous.",
            "I experienced the most devastating events of my life at this place since the death of my sister at the beginning of last year, and I just wanted to come on here to proclaim the goodness of God. Nothing is perfect because we are on this Earth and dealing with imperfect people. I can see with all the imperfection diligent people who are the hands and feet of Jesus whether they recognize him by that name or not. I can see the fruits of the spirit in 90% of the people here whether believer or non believer. Even though because of the negligent, abusive, and predatory actions of one individual my husband could die, God doesn't cease to be good. Jesus is still Lord and Master, worthy of every praise. No matter the damage. I must still bless those who have cursed me, so I bless the woman employed here who cursed my family. Knowing a curse without a cause will not stand because that's what the word of God says. You can't curse what God has blessed. I also thank the people for the vision to erect places like this with the intentions of blessing their community. To Jesus be all the glory honor and praise. Please, pray for my husband's healing. He always seems to slip through the cracks, but no matter what happens, I will proclaim God's goodness all the louder. He can prevent the loss of life, but even if He doesn't He STILL is, WORTHY, and GOOD. I thank the staff that face the struggle of working with this population, feeling the heartbreak, and forging forward for good. Lindsey, Cheyenne, Farah, Carmen, Chuck, Coach, Rob....servants and an inspiration. They love and work hard for their community and they care care. Gabe, Nikki, Rose, Sarah, Hunter, Jenny, Meagan, Misty, Chris, Derrick \ud83d\udc9b, and Ms. Barbara. You all make the lives of so many people better, and I thank God for the experience I had that devastated me because through that I learned how valuable and important people like you all are to this community. Thank you for what you do and may God bless you in your endeavors and strengthen you to do His will. Oh! And Clyde \ud83d\ude0a. Love you all. I am so terribly heartbroken, but there will be joy in the morning. Thank you Jesus, for TGI!",

They do absolutely nothing to help you . And people are getting high on fentanyl and they do nothing to them.also worker are suppose to be saved a dinner for when they get off work, but on many repeated occasions the pkate saved for workers are given to others already there who ate dinner and want more. So the people waiting for dinner have to wait till the next meal. I am one of a very few who works three jobs and still treated like a second class citizen.",
            "Went to the gathering inn and was treated like absolute garbage. They put me in a cot that was too small for my weight when there were bunks available and made me sleep on the floor for 3 day...so many bed bugs and the residents that live here do there best to try and get everyone else kicked out Feels like a prison then a place to get back on my feet service workers took over 2 weeks to even talk to me."

            "Just 2 hours ago I was accused of stealing by staff not just 1 or 2 but there were 3/4 staff members and security there waiting for me in the hall. They claimed I stole on camera also telling me that I\u2019d be discharged at 9am in the morning tomorrow Monday 3/23/2025\u2026 yet 4 hours later past 8 3/22/2025 they come and tell me I\u2019m not being discharged anymore  because they figured out who stole  by looking back further on the footage well before  my arrival from grocery shopping. You heard that right. They accused me (tried to frame me) of theft and lied to me that I was on footage just trying to pin it on me for stealing someone else\u2019s stuff  just so they didn\u2019t have to do the extra work to roll the tapes back earlier in the day\u2026 all that when I have a paying job why the hell would I need to steal?? One employee took it upon himself to check the footage again I\u2019m sure he sensed something wasn\u2019t right with this situation thankfully he saved my bed and found the truth out. Myself and very FEW others are actually on our path to obtain our goals and get out of here on our own like productive members of society unlike most (93%) here looking for a place to lay their heads while they continue their hard drug life (shelter Lifers). The shelter also facilitates a hostile living environment. Even with all the cameras in the world ima quote their favorite statement \u201cif we didn\u2019t see it or hear it it didn\u2019t happen\u2026\u201d how safe you\u2019d you feel in a place like this? Not to mention they do not take physical threats from others serious even if there\u2019s whitenesses around the staff has to physically be present no matter the situation\u2026 so you\u2019re out of luck on safety. Oh they recently changed their policies for the hopes homes here on campus now they allow drug addicts in active addiction to stay up at the on track housing here which if this places wasn\u2019t a crap show before it\u2019s by far the worst it\u2019s ever been here. I was here once before and had the worst experience I only lasted a month before deciding to take my chances and pay a ridiculous amount for rent unable to get main necessities  or end up in a tent , it was horrible when I arrived that first time. This time around they just wanna play with peoples health, safety and life even if ur on the right path and chalk any errors they make intentionally as \u201cwell I\u2019m just human BS\u201d WORST PLACE EVER!! If I had a dollar for every tweaked out or drunk person on property here I\u2019d be one rich minch by now. This place doesn\u2019t care about who they let in the don\u2019t care to segregate for safety, ALL ACTIVE ADDICTED INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE DEFERED TO CARES CAMPUS OF ANOTHER SHELTER FOR  sobriety AND HAVE A PLACE ALOCATED HERE FOR ESTABLISHED  people that are sober working on their goals. I wish they  have useful applicable rules that actually play out in real situations on property, this  is the worst front of an excuse to call this place a women\u2019s shelter helping others rise but by the looks of everything going on here it\u2019s a poop show run in a even crappier way, every week something changes to make things worse not better. I\u2019ve been caused so many hostile n threatening interactions that staff did nothing about any of it. I\u2019ve been caused emotional and mental distress and even had triggered panic attacks set off by people here and the staff being hostile and downright unprofessional in our treatment. If I could give negative stars I would in a heart beat. Living in a tent would be better than this. This is coming from someone on the property now. This place is the worst joke.",
            "This is the best shelter experience I've ever had the pleasure of being at. My family of 6 and my service dog have been homeless for quite some time. We were denied help at a California shelter because I have a service dog. At Our Place, they really do care. They've taken us in and given us a feeling of relief and safety. I  wish there were more places like this to give families a safe and clean place to rest and just get your lives back in order. Thank you, forever.",
            "I want to thank the people who helped me become a success story: my caseworker, Nick Simone, for helping me get back on my feet and get my life back in order. It makes a difference when you have case workers who care. I am grateful for my new caseworker, Julie she is awesome, too. Julie is part of the Subsidy Program of Washoe County. I am healing and battling breast cancer. And I have been through a lot here, too. Certain staff who cared got me through, like my former counselors Stephanie and Hilary. Now, my caseworkers Nick and Julie have added to my list of staff who care about people. Thank you for your humanity; it is so needed and means a lot. I appreciate you and your service. I hope more staff have a heart like you. I am glad God brought you into my life. May God continue to bless you and all that you do. God bless, and Amen. It is so nice to see a light at the end of the tunnel after a storm. Only the strong survive here. This is not a place to make friends but an opportunity for you to get your life together and move on. I am grateful for my blessings. One Love \ud83d\udc97 , Ophellia Hood",
            "I have been living in a home with black mold for 3+ years, as well as with my 9yo son, & it's greatly affecting our health, & I've tried every option available to me, all to no avail, so I went to Our Place to sign up to get out of our hazardous living conditions.\n\nWe were on the waiting list for over 2mos, & I thoroughly explained my situation, & on 8/12 they said we can move in & we were elated, that should tell you how bad the black mold is in our apartment, so we packed up all our things, well, I did all by myself, with having health & lung issues from Covid/Long Covid, as well as from the mold, but I pushed through, got it done & we moved in,  we slept SO GOOD that first night being out of that toxic situation!\n\nWell 2 days later my counselor there called me & said I have to return right away, to pack up & move out, without ANY explanation, or even worse ANY OTHER RESOYRCE, just said you gotta move back into your house, mind you I was at a Dr's appt finally trying to get my health dealt with since I was in a healthy environment, & they were just rushing me to get back to get outta there, & then most of them either avoided me, or ignored my texts/emails, HOW UNPROFESSIONAL, & CRUEL to do to a single father & his 9yo child! \ud83d\ude21\n\nThis should be taken even more serious than someone who is homeless, AT LEAST they're breathing healthy, clean air, NOT BLACK MOLD!!! \ud83d\udcaf",
            "Well the first day of only 1 week that I stayed there was in June 2024... The intake office, the two front desk ladies we're very nice... They take me to a worker chick who helped me get my belongings put up in a crate so that I wouldn't have to take some things getting stolen in the dorm room... Okay, get this... Sure I get it about the pillow I had which they had me throw it out ok... I also had a heating pad and a couple of pillow cases and my late doggies blanket that he died in, they made me throw it out or idono maybe they took it ! Then they took my favorite pairing knife and pair of hair cutting scissors and had security lock them up in which I never got back.... I was thankful for a place to stay honest I was but geez, they took from me of what little I had... The gave me a blanket and a set of sheets, put low case, a towel, and no pillow giving me a top bunk.. The dorm with all of those women was like being ( and myself included) one flew over the coocoos nest !!! Where we all needed to be under medication lol... It seemed there was every type of personality that walks the earth living a day to day life in a two room in one bunk room setting two bathroom and shower area... My first night of sleep there , I was cold, the air vent on the wall had been blowing right on me.. I was so cold .. I'm a woman of 54 yrs old so we automatically know I'm going to be either hot or cold . But this was added... Having a pillow I had to ask for one a few days later...Still all the while I'm thankful... I started to notice that a couple of these ladies had bags of belongings and clothing on their bed or next to... Iny head I struggled to understand why they made me throw away my things instead of locking them up or simply just putting these couple of items in a Ziploc lock until I was ready to leave the property for good, I was baffled because, there was just no reason for this seriously... The people working there , some were kind and some acted like you were less than them and had the tone of authority, like you better not hickup or imna put you in a straight jacket... They're probably trained for their positions which is fine but we all have different needs, need different kinds of help and at least can show a little bit of different kind of understanding.... The screaming matches between some of the women in there were foul... Like I said, one of every kind in the animal box as well as myself in addition..I'm by no means perfect at all . I treat people like I would like to be treated right... Lastly . Hours before I was going to speak to a caseworker. I walked down to the store for a fountain drink and something to snack on.. I grew some balls and bought myself a couple of shot bottles that I later had trouble opening...I had forgotten that I had them until I went out for y last cigarette in the middle of the night..I was searched and they found them... I know I was wrong to have caved and been feeling so weak and dumb for taking those or even buying that for that matter .. I admit I was wrong.. Was asked to leave outside of the property gate at 6am .. Just know that there are some people who you need not trust... You always have a target on your back... From my own experience, I hope to never be in the position of having stay in something like that again... Idono... Just be ready for a one sided situation, trust no one... Be strong and stay focused on the steps of getting back on your feet asap .. This facility needs better training for categorickly putting things and peoples situations into perspective... Alot of people have drug addictions , multiple personalities, schizophrenia, thieves, moochers,non showered ladies ... Or just simply people who'd like to just be left alone... They staff will only treat you good if they like you, so watch out !!!!! Trained in their jobs or not, Karma is going to be their best friend soon enough for the way that some treated some of them women...I admitted my downfall. Told I could come back. Nahhh!!! The shit o yr dignity, you're an animal in their eyes, to hell w/yr lowlife."

            "I lived there and after Renea left and Divine took over, it got a lot better. Then I think the power went to Divines head and he forgot it was a homeless shelter and not a prison. So many new rules coming from every direction, one after another. The project to turn the largest part of the dorm to medical beds only and throwing the men and women together. Firing some very vital, long- time staff members, Divines \"my way or the highway\" attitude. And the favouritism that is still shown to some of the clients there is unexplainable. I think Divine and Esmeralda need to print out a copy of the original \"MISSION STATEMENT\" and read it over and over again until they remember why they are there and exactly what being homeless has put a lot of their clients through. The trauma, the uncertainty, the danger, the fear, the horrors, the abandonment, loss, addictions, mental instabilities, and pain. These points are long forgotten at D st. shelter now and atany other shelters as well. I give Dst Shelter 1 star because they've lost the ability to show empathy, understanding, and support to those of us who REALLY need it\nGod Bless.",

They did not ask for anything but, you can donate money.  Out of their brokenness, they help others.\nI'm so thankful they where willing to help me in need.\nNow it's my turn to give back to them. I hope all the churches in the area get behind them to help.\nDonate good stuff that you don't need, to help them keep on keeping on.\nGod will bless you for it.\nJust tell people it's going to the mission. They will come pick it up, just not furniture. Women's and men's clothing, kitchen, tools, house stuff so they can use or sell it. Good things!",

The hiring process was smooth, and the training, led by the new training director, was well-structured and comprehensive. It included Crisis Prevention certification and HMIS database system certification, ensuring I was well-prepared for my role.\n\nAll directors conducted their lectures with professionalism and provided valuable insights to equip me for on-site responsibilities. The team is friendly and welcoming, and lead case manager Sophia offers exceptional support.\n\nI was assigned to the North 5th Street site, which is exceptionally clean and well-organized under Sheku\u2019s management. I highly recommend The Gathering Inn to prospective employees, as the compensation is competitive, and the benefits are excellent from the start.",
            "I called and explained my situation and that my son and I are homeless and was told sorry nothing they can do and ended the call with have a great day. Like yeah everyday is freaking great being homeless with a child.",
            "I live to declare the goodness of the Lord JESUS and show His glory and power. I thank Him for Roseville Gathering Inn. The directors changed while I was there, and I will say this about the current director... She is truly a representation of Jesus. She is directed by him, and not of man. She serves both the believing and non believing with the same love you read about Him having in the Bible. I was a recipient of said love. I thank God for Lindsey. Cheyenne was my case worker, very trying job she had to fit an hour in. I'm long winded, and was suffering the loss of my sister. Only people who know me know what that truly meant to my life. I probably died with her though I'm still breathing. None the less God is good. I thank Him for her life. Cheyenne offered me direction, encouragement, and with that, hope. I thank God for her. Truly was 3 months behind in my car note, lost my place, and breaking down because my sister passed when she got me. I prayed to God before I got here. I said you have to hold me Jesus because I'm not going to make it without you. Then I ended up here. I still have my car and more. Love that lady. Farah, Carmen \ud83d\udc9b, Chuck, Rob love love love these people. True servants. Ms. Kim \u2764\ufe0f, boy oh boy what can I say... Don't ever bring your child here to be scared straight like I did. He got so much love from the donation closet and the actual people in the shelter he didn't want to leave. Children at this shelter don't suffer in homelessness, and one would assume that is so. They are diligent, watchful, and protectors here staff and residents alike. The Gathering Inn fosters a strong community, and they accept EVERYBODY. Even people like me who was accepted nowhere, and they showed me LOVE and that pores over to my baby. That was HEALING. Thank you Jesus! Ms. Kim gave him some ridiculous toys PLURAL that couldn't fit in the back seat barely, and it was to my benefit because my mom and grandma were always distrusting of me. My mom entertained the thought of my son being with me overnight when I was here. After I left my mom opened up more and more because TGI helped so much my mama could see the difference. I am back with my family, and FULLY active in my son's life. Nikki was the first director when I came. This woman could do something only my sister could, understand me and talk to me in a way that cured my anxiety and brought me understanding in a SENTENCE. Usually people would have to wrestle with me or refuse me. She never had to. She had a way of knowing what was wrong that I couldn't articulate in my suffering and speak to that. Love her and I love this place. When a certain worker became hostile towards me along with certain residents, and actually harassed me with them, which NOBODY outside this one person ever did Lindsey didn't just take their side she listened to me covered protected and moved me. Some residents also covered and protected me too. These people that work here and this institution itself was the hands and feet of Christ in my life. A true answer to prayer. God is good. Thank you Jesus for TGI. You are good.",
            "I would not be alive and well today if it wasn't for The Gathering Inn. This place is a godsend and frankly, not enough. There needs to be many more locations and better prepared and trained staff members who have been through the program and successfully got their lives back who are able to relate and empathize and inspire hope.",
            "Stppoed by to say hello..utilized their services a couple years ago. Unfortunately as I'm allergic to mold staying in mainly old churches wrecked havoc on my sinuses. Beyond that 10 out 10 would recommend as they really try to assist the homeless.  And they have a clothing closet so if you are interested in donating it goes directly to those in need free of charge."

Nothing is perfect because we are on this Earth and dealing with imperfect people. I can see with all the imperfection diligent people who are the hands and feet of Jesus whether they recognize him by that name or not. I can see the fruits of the spirit in 90% of the people here whether believer or non believer. Even though because of the negligent, abusive, and predatory actions of one individual my husband could die, God doesn't cease to be good. Jesus is still Lord and Master, worthy of every praise. No matter the damage. I must still bless those who have cursed me, so I bless the woman employed here who cursed my family. Knowing a curse without a cause will not stand because that's what the word of God says. You can't curse what God has blessed. I also thank the people for the vision to erect places like this with the intentions of blessing their community. To Jesus be all the glory honor and praise. Please, pray for my husband's healing. He always seems to slip through the cracks, but no matter what happens, I will proclaim God's goodness all the louder. He can prevent the loss of life, but even if He doesn't He STILL is, WORTHY, and GOOD. I thank the staff that face the struggle of working with this population, feeling the heartbreak, and forging forward for good. Lindsey, Cheyenne, Farah, Carmen, Chuck, Coach, Rob....servants and an inspiration. They love and work hard for their community and they care care. Gabe, Nikki, Rose, Sarah, Hunter, Jenny, Meagan, Misty, Chris, Derrick \ud83d\udc9b, and Ms. Barbara. You all make the lives of so many people better, and I thank God for the experience I had that devastated me because through that I learned how valuable and important people like you all are to this community. Thank you for what you do and may God bless you in your endeavors and strengthen you to do His will. Oh! And Clyde \ud83d\ude0a. Love you all. I am so terribly heartbroken, but there will be joy in the morning. Thank you Jesus, for TGI!",

They should have more jobs skills like baking cookies croissants bun rolls pizza calzone phillo.

Every time I go to the facility it is clean and maintained properly.  Seeing the work that they are doing is so very needed for the future of the families they support.  If you are looking for a local nonprofit to support, please look at Gilead House in Novato.",

Gilead house was not understanding or empathetic towards me or my family.   I did not stay there long I was put out for no reason the program at the time was ran by Susan Sweet and she was absolutely out of touch with reality.   I have only one thing to recommend to Gilead house that they hire and employ people of color to work there that know and understands how to relate to other people of color.",

My 6-year-old child was called names and even pushed at Giliad House (I even had to wait for the police at 11 at night on the street). After this incident, we were actually kicked out on the street without further help to find another place for us! I was intimidated and threatened so that I would not carry our terrible story to the masses !!! The director of Giliad House did not provide us with other accommodation and ignored our requests for any help."

            "I was recently a temporary resident here I stayed for about a month and some change and I just want to say that this shelter is amazing. They service youth 18 to 24 and serve excellent food. The staff is amazing and friendly and the facility is within walking distance of Jack London Square with multiple things to do like bowling or walking the pier !!  And if you\u2019re feeling bold walk through the tunnel and go to target in Alameda !  It is so peaceful here I love it, they recently gave me $500 to move to Arizona and I\u2019ve been here in Arizona thriving ever since I can\u2019t thank  the covenant house enough if I could thank them 1 million times I would!!!!!! I 10 out of ten recommend this facility for 18 to 24 troubled youth",
            "I am a resident here. This is a lovely place. It has excellent food made by hardworking cooks, the staff are genuinely caring and altruistic, with decent rooms along with resources to meet anyone's basic needs. People who are giving it such a low rating are generally those who cause unnecessary drama, and then are surprised when the staff react negatively. While there are occasional staff mishaps...they get solved, sometimes it takes a day or three, but it gets worked out. It's places like these that help solve the crisis we are facing mental health-wise and poverty-wise within the US, and literally saves lives. Thank you to the staff, along with anyone who has made a place like this a possibility. It's heavily appreciated, and I know you're often not thanked enough.",

This place is a nice place but they have girls and boys there which is a big problem. If a girl says something to one of the A ministration staff even if it\u2019s true or an allegation they won\u2019t ask you anything they will kick you out like they did me on April 16th 2019. I\u2019m not the sexiest person but they have too many gay people working there they always taking female sides and even if you do have prove or a witness that means nothing it\u2019s them or nothing basically. My situation was very upsetting and I\u2019m still upset because now I\u2019m homeless & have no place to go. They claim they are there to help yes but there are times where some staff come into work with attitudes like really then you have the kitchen staff with attitudes when you just ask for a cup when there\u2019s no cups on the Counter. I been there for a year and they went through staff like water because people don\u2019t wanna work with them because its very It\u2019s unprofessional so how can you stop it only way is to get rid of the Director and all those Sexist staff in the covenant house of California.",
            "To be real honest Covenant House is the worst place to go to.. manipulative child traffickers and it ain't green.. To my expertise one of the many reason we still have homelessness is Covenant House there believe system through the system is corruption it's self comforting people to believe in God and destroying the very dream there house system stands for... I have witness more scenarios of children getting kicked out then housed.. destroying every childs dream through mismanagement. No real follow ups. Wasting youths lives for profit.\n\n\"I was housed by covenant house.. I thought I had a glorious future.. soon I started noticing them trying to change my daily habits, in my own light and perseverance fully knowing my Immigration status and issues. holding back resources for profit. Feeding on other youth through rituals of using the holy dove.\n\nCovenant house might have a few success story in it's own reverent through prospering youths but keep it real that witch craft gotta go.. and I do put my name on it...\n\n- Ame De"

            "Dear EOCP,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding the current living conditions in my assigned room. Over the past few days, I have been experiencing significant discomfort due to several issues that I believe require urgent attention.\n\nFirst, the cleanliness of the bathrooms is extremely poor, with the facilities in an unsanitary state. This is not only unpleasant but also a potential health hazard. Additionally, I have been placed in a room with roommates who have serious hygiene issues, which further exacerbates the situation. The room consistently has an overwhelming odor, and I have had to endure this environment daily, which has severely impacted my ability to rest and function.\n\nFurthermore, the room temperature is excessively high, resembling furnace-level heat. This has added to my discomfort, making the living situation intolerable. Last night, I was unable to sleep properly and was only able to fall asleep around 5:00 am after enduring the smell and the heat throughout the night.\n\nI kindly request to be moved to a dorm that is clean and free of these issues. I believe everyone deserves a living space that is sanitary and conducive to rest, and the current conditions are far from that standard.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution.\n\nSincerely,\nMike Masimalo\n(Who resides there)",
            "This place has potential to be a great place to get on your feet, unfortunately the staff has a problem dealing with different mind sets, it not a one case fits all, some are rude, disrespectful and at time down right nasty. There needs to be a change in the leadership.",

They currently have someone working there that have an active warrant for his arrest behind a dangerous crime. When i told the lady in charge she brushed it off. She is putting the residents there in danger",
            "These folks do a GREAT service for veterans who are homeless or needing other kinds of assistance. My case manager has always been very kind and helpful, and EOCP has really been there for me when I needed help!\n\nMy only issues are:  The lobby is extremely noisy, lacks enough seating for people waiting to be seen, and always seems to have flies circling the middle of the room. The security gate at the entrance is imposing and unwelcoming. I would love to see a mural out there, or even a friendly sign that makes you feel more welcome.\n\nThe lobby does have an awesome mural to look at, and the people behind the desk are usually friendly - very busy, and probably overwhelmed with so many things to do, but I do like them. You just have to be patient in waiting for them to get to you at times. I only say this because I know some people have a hard time with patience, but the staff really are nice people. Just give them a chance.\n\nEvery caseworker I've ever spoken to has been very helpful in answering my questions or referring me to someone who can answer my questions. Again, I am sure their caseloads are pretty packed, so sometimes return calls and emails are a little slow, so again, patience is the key."

            "I've been here for a few months now and mostly everyone has been very friendly and kind.\n\n( Edit I was kicked out for relationship issues with my partner while she was the one coming to me and holding me)\n\nThe only issue I've been having is there's no dedicated staff for services.\n\nBeing in and out the shelter daily they know my name and recognize me but not once have they asked me if I would like to get connected with services or need mental/physical health services.\n\nIt's okay, I mean it's very peaceful for the most part, and they do have 3 meals a day and potentially a snack as well.\n\nIt's been very appreciated and it's keeping me from being out in the weather with all my belongings. ( Update it was appreciated but they adon't really understand what 110 degree weather can do to people while sitting them outside in the sun all day)\n\nIf I could change one thing it would be people who are trying to work on themselves and leave should be able to stay in longer and have to go through a worker ( set appointments).\n\n( Update they did infact make that change but over all not strong enough to move people to want to seek there own life)\n\nThe idea is the people working to leave could use the PCs or even get resources that \"could\" help them.\n\nThe PC lab is very lackluster but looks nice... I walked in and had no clue what I needed to do to use the PC. ( Update it doesn't matter really there PC's are never fixed or looked at 3 hard drives have been ripped out the back of them and the best case scenario is to use your own devices and plug in via HDMI)",
            "I have a friend who lives there. The food is often a day close to their spoil date, or already spoiled, or some random things they threw together in a pot. I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food they offer to their Guests, it\u2019s disgusting. Most of it can\u2019t be named or really described. The beds aren\u2019t even supposed to be called beds. They are thin mats on Metal bunk bed frames. The mats are as thin as Gym mats. They get one small pillow and a thin blanket. They usually depend on donations to have food to eat. Today, in the morning, the shelter is out of milk, but it\u2019s a cereal day. They had one small cup of milk each for these tiny package cereals, like the ones they give you in hospitals. And the staff barely care and don\u2019t help the homeless people there get jobs. There is no recourses truly given to them. And this \u201cNew Start\u201d Program, for people who want to work but don\u2019t get paid. They also work AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER ITSELF. 8 hours everyday, one bus pass, a few privileges. That\u2019s it, they don\u2019t get paid anything. That\u2019s slavery almost. And 8 hours takes up the whole day and it\u2019s not consecutive, it\u2019s only when they are actively working. If you work in the Cafeteria, you have to be there all day. Serving, passing out snacks, prepping food. When will they ever use the bus pass? They have no off days in their work week either but don\u2019t get paid anything? This Shelter is using homeless people as well as not giving them opportunities for a better life. Don\u2019t go here. They don\u2019t care about you or your homeless friends or family or loved ones. People struggle.",
            "I have been \"living\" here for 3 months. Although I'm on the \"working persons program\" (since I recently became employed) they offer ABSOLUTELY NO HELP in terms of finding housing. There is absolutely no case management in terms of housing. I personally know of several people who have been there for years! I'm just in a rough patch and I need help. Although I need emergency help for a place to stay, I'm looking for help to have permanent residence and get back on my feet. They should offer a savings program and help you find a place to live. Also, the mattresses they provide are the same ones you would get if you were in Elmwood. Life is hard enough. I don't need to feel like i'm in jail. It just honestly feels like they're trying to keep as many people there as possible for as long as they can, so they can get paid for it. And certain staff members act like it's a burden to even talk to us. What's the point if ur not providing services to get the homeless housed?",
            "Humanity is special, and It's legacy.\nHelping others, and caring for people is so importantly for someone that needs it.\nThis place is very important, because it assistance with basic needs for US.\nThanks to all of you for your donations.",
            "This shelter works if you have no other options; you get a bed and bedding and linens are provided which is very helpful. They also have plenty of donations for if you need hygiene supplies or towels they even have some clothes donations which is helpful for people that come with nothing.  Aside from those benefits that I am grateful to have access to while I'm in this situation but the management and staff have no idea how to operate the facility smoothly.   My largest pet peeve about this shelter is how each staff member has their own rules that they like to enforce.  This is extremely unprofessional in my opinion they need to have a standardize list of rules and conduct that way when you go to ask a question there is one answer no matter who you are asking."

U charge ppl u shouldn't charge and act like saints about it that's the truth like every other program Don't believe the hype even when your brand new in town they refuse u to stay if your not there at a specific time as if you'd know to be when your new and looking for help there paid and funded to help I ask u half thug half pastors where's the help practice more of what u preach I'm down with God and it don't cost me anything? Emmanuel house is better there strict but more friendly more professional loaves and fishes for food that's the best place there is been in town two weeks and city team is the worst place to go try it yourself but actually look at what's going on",

I did their phone screening like two or three times, and they gave me the wrong address to the wrong housing program. The lady not only rejected me, but let me know in several ways that their housing programs are not affordable housing."

Shame on you for being rude and inconsiderate to someone seeking mental health help. Not everyone wants to call 911, have authorities in their home or be placed on a hold.

Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",
            "This place is a blessing! This was my first time being homeless I was scared I didn\u2019t know what to do. They were so kind to me, took me in And comforted me through such a hard time. The staff are wonderful and have supported me the week. I have been here. I got an apartment so I will be leaving tomorrow so blessed that this place is here in our community to help out people who are in need. Big shout out to the staff! Chaz you were amazing thank you so much for being so kind and such a sweetheart! Chrissy, you were amazing Thank you so much for our beautiful Conversations\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ms.  May thank you for showing me and teaching me about boundaries. I love each and every single one of you guys. Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

            "My life changed dramatically at Rescue the children. The staff excepted me when i was broken and hopeless with open arms. I was in a dark place but I met God there and he broke that darkness off my life. The staff taught me how to love myself again and believe for more in my life because God had good plans for me. I learned working skills I never knew I had and how to serve as Christ did. I had never worked before but now I have been working there for over 4 years. In not one department but 3 different departments. They helped me go back to school and now I am a registered counselor. Of course I give all glory to God but it was God in the hearts of the staff and volunteers that restored my hope in humanity. I have witnessed lives changed day after day and will always be great full for The Fresno Mission all departments. Thank you and God Bless all the staff and men and women and children that.enter in",
            "Been supporting and volunteering with the mission over the last 6 months and they are amazing. God is blessing the efforts there through the disciples and staff. The staff is so caring and compassionate. If you are on the fence about getting involved, jump in! God is moving there and the work they do is saving lives on earth and for eternity!",

As well as job placement assistance.It was a total life change. I just want to thank the mission for taking me off the streets and showing me how to live A life of sobriety.",
            "I was rather shocked listening to the recent (Jan 2022) television campaign launched by the Fresno Mission listing all of the terrible things that can cause a crisis: \"I'm a single mom with five kids, one of whom is autistic, and I cannot keep it all together crisis. We have a, \"I didn't choose this life.\" crisis.\n\nAs a mother of an autistic child who watches TV, I thought to myself, how would I explain this to my child if he was watching right now? When there are so many disabilities that can afflict a child and family, why did they single out autism specifically as a contributor to this mother's crisis? Surely I know that having any special needs child is a challenge, but shouldn't we just call them \"special needs\" in an ad campaign. Why single out a certain group in a negative way like this. I strongly oppose cancel culture and having to be politically correct all of the time. But to single out a vulnerable population by name like this is really insensitive."

            "Upon hearing about the shelter I was pretty optimistic about the things i heard from a county sheriff. Once I got in there and an spoken to an employee at the front desk work. In the moment i was optimistic for the future for good reasons as she was a very kind, respectful, and genuinely empathetic of my situation..\nThis optimism quickly went away after having the first meeting with my caseworker whose job was supposedly to help me out with finding and securing permanent housing. Not only did she label my case as a self resolve case meaning that when it comes to trying to find permanent housing in the city it would still be completely on me. she had no real help to offer. That in itself was very disappointing news for me at a very hard time but on top of having to receive the disappointing news she also talked to me like I was completely incompetent and in grade school the entire time !!! making me feel very belittled and overall worse about myself for putting myself in the situation. Understandable to believe that someone who is my age at the age of 23 must\u2019ve done a bunch of bad stuff To get him in the position financially that im in but from what my grandmother had told me originally just because someone has bad character (although i dont) doesn\u2019t justify bad action. In the remainder of the week I was there. The span of my stay being only about a week and a half maybe two weeks I\u2019ve been assaulted by my roommate and when I say assaulted I mean I woke up to a 6\u20192 close to 300 pound 19-year-old hitting me in my face . after already voicing my concerns about my roommate to one of the workers that were there during the night shift. to add to it upon my departure from the shelter after my bed was closed by my case worker\nFor coming in past curfew although I had every form of excuse They had originally said would be Accepted On top of a job I was working full-time The promises of storage that was given to me which I have in text stated that I would have 30 days to ultimately grab all of my things or it would be disposed of or donated. Three days into my supposed storage I went back to the shelter to collect my things with a mentor of sorts only to be told that somehow my things had been stolen. Even considering the situation I was in and the loss of what I\u2019d like to say most of my life savings there were still no empathy from any of the workers or any real investigation done to figure out what happened to any of my things as far as I see it when it comes to anybody who fits my description you\u2019re probably better off getting a storage on your own and just sleeping on the streets because not only will you be undermineded and taunted for your current position you will also put yourself in the position of being victimized by the people that claim they want to help you!!",
            "Amazing place, giving young adults every opportunity to get their ducks in a row and get some help financially as well. Lots of rules but nothing outlandish. Can't say enough good things about this program and how it helped me.",
            "1. No doors on the rooms 2. Some staff is rude as hell 3. Keep lights on 24/7 even when going to sleep 3. Repeatedly try to kick people out during the day 4. Case Manager on vacation when I moved in here 5. No storing food or drink and if so is violation 6. Hypervigilant staff wanting to write up everyone for everything 7. First week here and not good 8. A couple hours notice before throwing food out 9. First week here and 1 review so says a lot 10. No bar to hang my clothes in the room",

            "I was at the Ventura county rescue mission last week on a Tuesday and Wednesday I spent the night I was treated horribly by staff on Wednesday night my last night there that would have been last week I believe I believe it was the 19th I spent the night there I got cussed out challenge to a fight by a by somebody that was spending the night there woke up in the morning because I was on my way to work because I got woken up at 5:38 in the morning I was on my way to work I grabbed the pastry I got met with hostility by one of the residents who said this the guests eat first you guys eat last I'm like well I'm on my way to work I was just grabbing something as I was talking to one of the residents one of the guys a black guy with dreads told me leave the premises for basically saying what was being done he told me leave the  premises or you're going to lose your bed that's when I decided to spend the night in the hotel before I came back to the Ventura county rescue mission this place needs to be investigated for sanitary reasons it needs to be investigated the staff for how they treat people and needs to be investigated because the utensils are not clean dirty with things and food still on them my name is Yusef Salaam. It is by far the worst program that I've ever been to and I do not recommend it to anybody like I said your program it's facility it's cleanliness it's not top-notch as the first review says that gave five stars that's false advertising the director of this establishment needs to get on top of his staff about their rudeness about how they interact with people because it is not godliness and I don't feel no godliness coming out of a christian-based facility that's supposed to help people but at the same time you keep people down you guys might have just well start saying you're a rescue mission and just keep God out of it. And stop blaspheming",
            "The Ventura County Rescue Mission is top notch. The staff\nis the best. They don't discriminate against the disabled like someone posted in the comments. The staff is very friendly and fair.",
            "I found myself homeless. I am in a wheelchair. It says this wheelchair accessible however they won\u2019t let people in wheelchair. Stay the night. I don\u2019t know if this is a violation of American with disabilities act. The reason they gave me was that they don\u2019t have any handles in the showers. It just seems if they\u2019re gonna say they wheelchair accessible on the website here they should be wheelchair accessible.",
            "It is by far the worst experience Of my life. My son was there. The staff is rude and cold and have a better than demeanor. They are not welcoming to any questions you may have and God forbid you question anything that goes on behind those walls. You will become their # 1 enemy if you so much as question anything they say. Rules apply when they want to whom they want and at their convenience. The staff is cold, and condescending. Quick to anger if you don\u2019t do what they ask even if it is not required of you to do so. They are not welcoming to any concerns residents families may have and absolutely hate when family members are involved. I have never in my life seen staff behave in such a way at any other recovery home. They leave residents to fend for themselves and only become interested in helping if it concerns anything monetary. They  make you feel like your needs are a chore. They are lazy. And there are many safety issues. My son went without medication for a week when that is one of their conditions if you are staying there and take medication. Refused to allow me to take him to refill it and was told I would have to wait a month to do so. When I mentioned it to another staff member they insisted that I take my son that very day to go get it. You ask a different person you get a different answer from each and every one of them there. My son was attacked and the persons that instigated suffered no consequences and staff didn\u2019t even bother questioning why my son had 2 black eyes. This is the absolute worst place to take a young adult teen that has never been in recovery before. The hallways often smell like marijuana and staff often turn a blind eye or they care very little about what goes on to even notice anything is going on. It is absolutely disturbing to hear that while my son was there  a resident was beaten so badly by other residents they had to stay at the hospital for a few nights. Luckily for rescue mission staff the victim was a transient and had no family that would be concerned about his well being. I do believe that there a couple staff members that indeed care about the residents but the majority of them are the exact opposite of what they claim to be. I regret sending my son there. I would insist that if anyone is looking for a caring supportive safe environment to send they\u2019re loved one to that they look elsewhere. You won\u2019t find any of that here.",
            "I was here shortly after 9/11/01. When they found out I enlisted they immediately put me out on the street. Chief was awesome and so was their wrecker driver(Scott? Red haired guy) at the car lot. Other than those guys it was what it was."

            "I recently visited interfaith in Sonora,ca. A lady named Deborah informed me they could help me get a battery for my RV I just needed to bring a quote for the battery so I went to Napa Auto parts. Then returned to Deborah office whom upon my first visit stated that she to was once homeless so I thought she cared about me and my struggles since my of wife's  recent passing. 33years married to the love of my life. But thanks to living in toulomene county where most of the citizens are a product of in breading it really should come as no surprise to me that she is a liar and has no interest in truly helping anyone. So beware if you ever need help I would not recommend going to them for assistance. Thanks to Sargent passuqie (misspelled) touolueme county sheriff giving me a ticket for out of date registration. fine $160.00 which I just bought in January of 2024  and registration cost $785.00 the registration should not have been due until January of 2025. But thanks to the seller having lied about his wife having paid to keep vehicle on non-op. Again a citizen of toulomene countys (embreaded population) I am done with living in a society that has no compassion for anyone but them selfs,where lying is okay and the welfare system is a joke and if your a Senior Citizen in this county (good luck) because no one cares about you not even the ones displaying the cross that my Savior Jesus Christ died on as part of their business advertisement is all fake misleading which offers nothing more than creating a false sense of caring to for it's citizens. As for the Sargent for toulomene county again (my guess is a product of embreading) hello new State Law effective 2024 States it is illegal for officers to ticket a person for simply having expired tags for 60 days but on the start of the 90 day they can legally issue you a ticket the exception is if a driver has committed some other type of motor vehicle infraction can they issue a ticket.. know the law if your in a position of enforcing the laws.  Oh it's no superise that Debroah and The fine Sargent choose to profile the less fortunate by demonstrating what can happen when you are a product of embreading in toulomene county.  That's it I'm done you win have lived a fair life but I can't take it anymore so I'm going to say goodbye and pray for God's forgiveness for my selfish actions. Both Deborah \u00e0nd the good Sargent should not be in a position where they can cause people to loose hope and cause people to take their lives. Especially in positions where they have a duty to protect and serve the citizens (weather imbread or not) all people deserve better treatment no matter to their situation may be good luck and good bye oh I know who cares anyway right.",

The receptionist is rude, does not know how to do her job correctly or efficiently. If I could give zero stars I would. This place is a waste of time due to the rude receptionist who won\u2019t let me speak to a manager. And she does not say her name when she answers the phone. Find another job this field your in is for people who need to take care of court cases and be pointed in the right direction if you guys don\u2019t offer a service you should be knowledgeable of the area and services around you.

There is a small tax of helping lend a hand in keepig the place.  Clean a dish. Sweep the floor. Push in a chair. Carry in some goods. It goes a long ways."

            "People were smoking in the line and once they got in, I noticed at least one person continuing to smoke. He was at the table that is for assisting the homeless so I'm assuming he was one of the workers which makes it worse. A worker should know better than to smoke in a shelter. That shows a lack of care for the homeless because they are forced to breath the smoke if they want to sleep there.\n\nThey didn't provide any beds, or pillows or blankets or anything. We were told to sleep inside the gated area but outside the building in the cold. I was told that I could pick a spot on the concrete floor to sleep on. I expected a shelter to have beds and blankets so my only option was to sleep on the hard concrete floor in the cold. My back started to hurt so I decided that I was better off on my own.\n\nOne of the homeless said they sneak in weapons and that he has a weapon on him now. He also said that they will steal from each other. That tells me that the security to get inside is really poor. The homeless guy said he likes this shelter because they are less strict than other shelters. Personally I would prefer a shelter that was more strict like no smoking in the sleeping areas for example. I would never go back.",
            "Recent Feburary 2025 Review.\n\nFor Donors and Organizations I highly encourage you send one of your staff or yourself in the shoes of a normal everyday homeless person and see what's really going on with your money here, join the programs and stay for a week, and you'll see the issues I highlighted below.\n\nDon't fall for a \"Scheduled Tour\", show up unannounced and ask to see the property immediately or simply start walking around and checking it yourself.\n\nThe Owner or whoever is on the Top Level needs to start being personally involved much more often, because otherwise the only solution is Investigation and Exposure.\n\nThe Staff needs to be cleaned out Top to Bottom for the most part, while Ex-Residents have an idea of how it operates, they shouldn't be employed post-release, as this gives them a sense of ownership and favoritism that isn't in the Midnight Missions best interest of Solving Homelessness.\n\nThe end goal of a homeless shelter should be to close down once it accomplishes its goal.\n\nPhotos/videos of the street, lines, and eating times need to be published so people see the real issues. On the surface it appears to be a very good organization, but they would have better luck burning and tearing down the entire block and the ones around it. The pictures you see online is a place that simply does not exist in reality, it is vague clout chasing.\n\nThe Handling of California Government Assistance is also very sketchy as the staff wants to be abnormally involved in facilitating things like GR,CalFresh,MediCal, if investigated, it's possible you would find abuse of these funds and benefits for the lesser capable individuals.\n\nPortion Control, Food Quality, Food Preparedness, Food Safety, Could be heavily looked upon, Sometimes there is too little, sometimes they give you enough for five people. There's no sense of balance or rationing.\n\nI understand they need to serve a large amount of people who are at times not the best mannered, but if someone doesn't start running this place that actually knows how to be assertive they are just contributing to the problem /behavior and enabling it.\n\nIt'd be better to close this place down, restart it entirely, and open it up with better management. Whoever is running this place has no clue how homelessness actually works and how to fix it, they are simply keeping the problem in limbo.\n\nThis is a For-Profit Homeless Shelter, meaning they want to keep this Machine going as long as it brings income.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to spend a couple days, weeks, or whatever time is needed to come in with a different approach as people are -Reliant- on this Shelter and that will not push them to go try and make a change.",

It's a process to get in (you need to take a TB test then orientation) but I had a bed and breakfast for the next 6 months while I went to school and they refer me to another program that got me an apartment for $50 a month!\nI've been in my own place for 4 years! All I have to do is just let them visit me for 5 minutes every month and that's only to check up on me to see if I need anything like a haircut voucher or a box of food.\nThe only thing is that the curfew is at 7:30pm and you have to leave after breakfast (which is 7:30pm, if I remember right), unless you work or go to school. If you're on drugs then you probably won't make it, even with those simple rules (from what I saw).

Timing couldn't be any better the Hartman house was opening within weeks. I was there roughly two months and during that time I was shown their compassion and caring I needed during that time. I'm forever grateful for the help they gave me. Clean and peaceful atmosphere and if you happen to be blessed with the opportunity to stay there, I would recommend that you embrace it with all your ability. Thank you Pathways to Housing.",
            "This newly established facility is tremendous. After being involved in an accident and unable to work or provide for myself temporarily, this facility opened it's doors to me, to help me.\n\nThere is a doctor, psyche, case manager, and other resources on-site weekly. Generally, meals are provided otherwise it is relatively independent living. Males and Females are housed in separate, clean, accommodating, dorm-type living arrangements. Appliances on sight to help with clean apparel, which if you are lacking, can also be provided from local donations.\n\nA swift, safe, comfortable, and pleasant recovery from my accident was a blessing that I believe many people could also benefit from. The staff is wonderful and goes above and beyond every day to ensure the clients are happy.\n\nShasta Community Health Center/H.O.P.E provides the medical portion for patients while Pathways To Housing leads with the housing/facilities. Both are reputable organizations and if they offer you a referral, it will doubtless aide your situation. A gem of the community!",

I do come into contact very regularly with many of the homeless people in Redding and who passed through Redding. It's just kind of funny because almost every one of them who's been around a while has made use of the beneficence found at the mission but on the other hand they quickly move into all the negative things they can think of. Mostly and I hate to say it, it is just a lot of victim mentality and entitlements spirits working and the mission doesn't fulfill all of their desires so they end up being ingrates.\nI don't remember but I think it's been pushing 60 years since the mission has been here helping people.

            "I stayed at One SAFE Place and am greatful that I did. They were able to give me enough time to get on my feet with my children, find a job and housing. There were a couple of bad apples there with the other clients and gossip and all that garbage but that's to be expected in a house full of women. The staff at times was not entirely professional and a little gossipy too but that's life. If you are determined to get your life together after a bad relationship, this is the place. Focus on your goals and dreams and don't let the petty stuff ruin your journey.\nMy children and I are doing well in part to the help we got here.\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I am going to try to be really objective here.  This agency is really helpful if you are in a situation where you need to leave quickly AND you have family, friends or resources available to you after your stay. Here is where I have a problem.  The max stay at OSP is 45 days.  If you have nowhere to go after that or have no one to help you, you are going to end up back with your abuser who is now even angrier and more violent.  They don't disclose this when you call in.  It's just \"come in and we will help you\".  They really can't help you with housing because in Shasta county the wait for subsidized housing is a minimum of about 6 months for project based subsidized housing and much longer for a section 8 voucher. In my case, I met with Cyndi, who was amazing.  She had me use the OSP address when I applied for section 8 because I did not want the person I was leaving to find out what I was planning.  Somehow, Cyndi ended up not working there and when the housing agency sent my paperwork to them, they dropped the ball and I got purged from the list. When I returned to see what they could do.  I got no explanation or apology.  I met with a 20 something advocate who seemed pretty clueless and didn't seem too keen on contacting the housing authority to help sort this mess out. She kept hammering on a restraining order.  While a restraining order is helpful in some situations, it can be dangerous or damaging in others.  I.E. with a narcissist. I worked for 15 years in the counseling field so I know what I am talking about.  Staff needs to be trained in these nuances because these are people's lives.  Good intentions can quickly lead to bad consequences. It seems like there is pretty high turnover at this agency which is never a good thing.  I am not sure how they are funded but IMHO it is time to look at something like a transitional tiny home community with units that can fit individuals with children where they can have a stay long enough to truly address barriers like access to housing.  Again, I am not picking on OSP but I think they need to address some of these issues.",

Today I want to leave and a lady answered saying they don\u2019t do that and just asked about a restraining order. That makes no sense to me when I\u2019ve called before and got real help. Sounds wishy washy. I am in nursing school, no kids, family lives 4+ hours away with no car right now and needed help. This time I was let down and am being abused. I can\u2019t just be homeless.",

            "I was at the Ventura county rescue mission last week on a Tuesday and Wednesday I spent the night I was treated horribly by staff on Wednesday night my last night there that would have been last week I believe I believe it was the 19th I spent the night there I got cussed out challenge to a fight by a by somebody that was spending the night there woke up in the morning because I was on my way to work because I got woken up at 5:38 in the morning I was on my way to work I grabbed the pastry I got met with hostility by one of the residents who said this the guests eat first you guys eat last I'm like well I'm on my way to work I was just grabbing something as I was talking to one of the residents one of the guys a black guy with dreads told me leave the premises for basically saying what was being done he told me leave the  premises or you're going to lose your bed that's when I decided to spend the night in the hotel before I came back to the Ventura county rescue mission this place needs to be investigated for sanitary reasons it needs to be investigated the staff for how they treat people and needs to be investigated because the utensils are not clean dirty with things and food still on them my name is Yusef Salaam. It is by far the worst program that I've ever been to and I do not recommend it to anybody like I said your program it's facility it's cleanliness it's not top-notch as the first review says that gave five stars that's false advertising the director of this establishment needs to get on top of his staff about their rudeness about how they interact with people because it is not godliness and I don't feel no godliness coming out of a christian-based facility that's supposed to help people but at the same time you keep people down you guys might have just well start saying you're a rescue mission and just keep God out of it. And stop blaspheming",
            "The Ventura County Rescue Mission is top notch. The staff\nis the best. They don't discriminate against the disabled like someone posted in the comments. The staff is very friendly and fair.",
            "I found myself homeless. I am in a wheelchair. It says this wheelchair accessible however they won\u2019t let people in wheelchair. Stay the night. I don\u2019t know if this is a violation of American with disabilities act. The reason they gave me was that they don\u2019t have any handles in the showers. It just seems if they\u2019re gonna say they wheelchair accessible on the website here they should be wheelchair accessible.",
            "It is by far the worst experience Of my life. My son was there. The staff is rude and cold and have a better than demeanor. They are not welcoming to any questions you may have and God forbid you question anything that goes on behind those walls. You will become their # 1 enemy if you so much as question anything they say. Rules apply when they want to whom they want and at their convenience. The staff is cold, and condescending. Quick to anger if you don\u2019t do what they ask even if it is not required of you to do so. They are not welcoming to any concerns residents families may have and absolutely hate when family members are involved. I have never in my life seen staff behave in such a way at any other recovery home. They leave residents to fend for themselves and only become interested in helping if it concerns anything monetary. They  make you feel like your needs are a chore. They are lazy. And there are many safety issues. My son went without medication for a week when that is one of their conditions if you are staying there and take medication. Refused to allow me to take him to refill it and was told I would have to wait a month to do so. When I mentioned it to another staff member they insisted that I take my son that very day to go get it. You ask a different person you get a different answer from each and every one of them there. My son was attacked and the persons that instigated suffered no consequences and staff didn\u2019t even bother questioning why my son had 2 black eyes. This is the absolute worst place to take a young adult teen that has never been in recovery before. The hallways often smell like marijuana and staff often turn a blind eye or they care very little about what goes on to even notice anything is going on. It is absolutely disturbing to hear that while my son was there  a resident was beaten so badly by other residents they had to stay at the hospital for a few nights. Luckily for rescue mission staff the victim was a transient and had no family that would be concerned about his well being. I do believe that there a couple staff members that indeed care about the residents but the majority of them are the exact opposite of what they claim to be. I regret sending my son there. I would insist that if anyone is looking for a caring supportive safe environment to send they\u2019re loved one to that they look elsewhere. You won\u2019t find any of that here.",
            "I was here shortly after 9/11/01. When they found out I enlisted they immediately put me out on the street. Chief was awesome and so was their wrecker driver(Scott? Red haired guy) at the car lot. Other than those guys it was what it was."

For a place that is supposedly trying to 'help' people, they are ridiculously intrusive on your privacy, as well as demeaning and disrespectful to you as a person. The vibe & atmosphere there feels very much like minimum security jail. Not the feeling one should have to experience when one is trying to move on and better their lives. A person named Tamara was the head when I was there; a very unfriendly and rude individual. I got the feeling that she does not like people of color, particularly black people. I understand we all have hard times & situations that may fall upon us, but I would definitely avoid this place like the plague if at all possible."

They bring you under the guise that it is a homeless shelter, they first tell you your paying for shelter fees and that they want a 3 month commitment $650 a month for single bed in a shared room then once you sign you are told you are paying for \u201c the program\u201d no one is paying the same amount almost like they charge what they want to charge that moment but in reality \u201cthe program \u201c is being enforced by other homeless residents who can be found in their spare time panhandling at the local grocery store. They are taken advantage of women in need and most of the positive reviews are the favored residents and friends of the director I have filed reports with dhcs/dfeh THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HOMELESS WHOM THEY KNOW HAVE VERY LITTLE OPTIONS IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TAKE THEM THIS \u201cprogram\u201d is a set up",
            "The place is infested with mice and roaches!!! The directors refuse to call pest control all they do is bomb and put down boric acid which obviously is NOT working. boric acid is extremely poisonous and there are a lot of young children living there which is concerning. It\u2019s $400 for you and $100 per child. Some residents were paying over $800 to live in filth with bugs and rodents. It\u2019s extremely sad. Me and my child were sick our entire time at love a child, we didn\u2019t get better until we left. I had to take my child to the emergency room because a roach was stuck in their ear and my child was admitted and had to be treated for an infection with antibiotic's. The director dismissed me from the program because I had to stay overnight in the hospital with my child but honestly I was relieved because I did not want to return! They threatened to throw all of my belongings away if I did not retrieve by the end of the day. They wrote me up for missing church although I provided them a doctor\u2019s note stating that me and my child were sick. I constantly got written up because the rules are unclear and certain rules only apply to certain residents. The staff are residents but they get away with things that other residents get written up for. They\u2019re allowed to let their children play outside unattended with no shoes or proper clothes on but if another resident does that they are written up. The staff residents will literally write you up for anything just because they can. This program is obviously taking advantage of vulnerable women with children. Staff residents are obvious drug users but directors do not care. They do not drug test you upon acceptance into the program so they basically let anyone in. They say that they do random drug tests but the residents I talked to on a daily basis while I was there said they had never been drug tested during their time there. One resident even bragged about leaving to go smoke Meth. They do not provide any housing resources! They do not do case management!

I was dismissed from the program for being in the main office at 7pm.\n\nI was a late intake the day previously and had support with my domestic violence advocate. I was extremely tired and didn\u2019t catch all of the information. I figured I would find out more the next day. I went to sleep, left the property early on the morning- before 645a to get to work. The website says that they help with transportation to work, THEY DONT. It took me 3 hours to get to work via bus and BART for a 3 hour shift, and another 2-3 hours to get back. I was gone all day.\n\nI called the program prior to arriving, letting them know I was gone at work and making my way back. I arrived back to the property around 645p and entered the office.  I went in to ask questions about the program, how to fill out my schedule, and what I needed to do for classes, etc. I left quite early in the morning and knew I missed information so I was just asking for tips.\n\nI am not familiar with Pittsburg at all and wanted to know more about the are, how to get around, advice and things like that. As I was talking to the woman, we talked about God, my journey, etc. I felt so much better. All of a sudden a woman named Courtney whom I have never met before or seen before came in to say that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be in there. She spoke to the woman as if I were not there and said something along the lines of \u201cyou can\u2019t let these people in here just tell them no. I saw the camera.\u201d It was extremely rude and unwelcoming and I calmly explained that I was a new intake, and wanted to know more information and I took it upon myself to come in and ask what the requirements were, what I missed, classes.\n\nThe woman, Courtney said I needed to leave and could finish tomorrow. She then started speaking down to the new employee. This new employee is part of their work adjustment program and only made $10 for the WHOLE 8 hour shift. I calmly explained again to Courtney that this woman was just trying to help. I\u2019m fleeing domestic violence and I\u2019m in an unfamiliar area. Courtney said someone would call me and explain. I don\u2019t believe that because nobody called me that day, I actually called in twice, and nobody knew who I was.\n\nI explained to Courtney that I didn\u2019t appreciate her tone and asked how they would get ahold of me since they failed to do so\u2026 and she quickly glanced at my work schedule and was like \u201cwe can have an appointment with you on Tuesday at 130p. I said that\u2019s fine but I want my DV advocate there. As I\u2019m trying to pack up to leave, she says, that Love a Child has no gates and I\u2019m free to leave whenever I want. I explained that that was not what I wanted and I was grateful to be there.\n\nI told her I wasn\u2019t feeling comfortable talking to her, explained I had a social work background, and legal background. She asked what does it have to do with the conversation. I explained that she was escalating the situation, I have PTSD. She got visibly upset, and said I was being insubordinate and I was dismissed from the program. I asked her to please call my advocate and that any discussions and decisions need to be made by her as my PTSD symptoms were exacerbated by her.\n\nShe proceeded to cal police and told them I was there refusing to leave property. I said alright thank you, please call my advocate. They could not get in touch with my advocate.\n\nAs I was walking back to my unit (where I had only been there one night), she approached me saying I was free to pack my stuff. I was already going to grab my stuff, what was the point of her approaching me like that? To exacerbate my symptoms even MORE?\n\nApparently Courtney goes to Bay Church Concord, I also attend there. I\u2019m so disappointed in how she handled the situation. This is not how a Christian behaves. I slept on the street last night. Had nothing with me and it was 50 degrees last night.\nIsaiah 54:17 is what gets me through. But I am so sad and hurt by the lack of support especially female support.",
            "Tbh I had the worst experience i was in the hospital take to mind I was pregnant they called me the next day after I delivered my baby that if I didn\u2019t pay my program fees I would lose my bed I had no where else to go I had my 2 kids my oldest 8 my middle 6 and my newborn they had no sympathy for what I was going through. This program lacks compaction and respect for there residents and the office needs lots of work Shannon needs to get out the office and Courtney needs to open her eyes. I am thankful but living at love a child shouldn\u2019t b hard like they make it.",
            "I didn\u2019t get the chance to stay here. But I did go through the application process . This shelter charges $450 for a single person to stay in a bed with also a $50 intake fee. This is a lot for someone who has zero income. They said that they would help even if you could not pay . But for me there\u2019s too many requirements that made my decision about staying here. One requirement that surprised me is that If your dr has prescribed meds to you, you have to be on them to come into this program. Which was a no for me because I was in the process of changing drs & the medication she had me on induced diabetes so I had to stop taking them. If you want to be in this program you have to take all meds prescribed by your doctor no excuses. I would not recommend based off how much you have to pay just to be provided a bed."

Shame on you for being rude and inconsiderate to someone seeking mental health help. Not everyone wants to call 911, have authorities in their home or be placed on a hold.

How are they helpful to me?? Really. Thank you but much improvement is needed. And the janitor is an absolute dirtbag bully. He turns up on all kinds of people and bully's all kinds of clients. It's racism and he should be kicked to the curb. He does it to all kinds of people. A lot. Than the staff has his back when he is way wrong. He is destroying people's lives ( not mine I'm always good) but others yes. It's complete racism someone needs to look into it it's sick. And I've heard from staff that they have let people die there on purpose. I don't know if that's true but the staff said it and i think that's morbid. I love helping people so when people who are supposed too do like that it makes me vomit in my mouth. Sick. Janitors a dirtbag needs reprimand.

            "If I could I would give Wiseplace 0 stars!! I called twice and left a very detailed voicemail speaking slowly and repeating my number twice. Both times, I never got a call back and my phone and voicemail are working perfectly fine.",
            "I stayed at this place.  When I went in, I asked how long I could stay there, after my time was up if I could sign up again and come back, etc.  I was told that I could stay up to four months and I could put my name on again for the waitlist.\n\nThe time comes toward the end and I have been communicating with my case manager about my extended fourth month.  She did not give any indication of any difficulty of getting my fourth month extension.  However, about a week before my time was up, I was told that I could not get my fourth month stay.  When I requested to be put on the wait list, then, I was told that I could enter into the program only once!  I asked if that was only once in a lifetime and my case manager said, \"Yea, pretty much.\"  I was so close of filing for a discrimination charge against this agency because there were several ladies who have been in the program previously.  I couldn't believe how she would lie through her teeth with a straight face!\n\nThen, there was this other lady who always wanted to give me a hard time of how I spent my money.  She liked to say that the site that I was shopping at was as expensive a Nordstrom Rack.  But I didn't think Nordstrom Rack was an expensive place to shop at.  I really felt like saying, \"Listen!  I'm at a homeless shelter right now, but you have no idea of how I grew up.  Hands off; back off!\"  Then, things got even worse and one day she asked me how much money I had in my checking account and if I was going to pay my rent via my checking account.  I should have told her \"None of your damn business!\"  I told her that I wasn't going to pay my rent via my checking account but my savings account.  Then, she wanted to know how much money that I had in my savings account.  I told her.  Then, she says, \"Oh, so you have money to pay for your rent!\"  Uh, hello?  I never said that I didn't have money to pay for my rent?\nShe ran my credit score and I told her I was really curious about my credit score because I never ran my credit score before.  We looked in to my report and she said, \"So, you never had any late payments and your credit score is good.  I thought you had a reason to be worried!\"  I was just amazed!  Who said that I was worried?  I found it amazing how the workers would say that they were homeless too and they understood.  But, I thought they were so judgmental.  None of the workers had more education than I did, they didn't have better credit scores than I did, and they didn't have more savings/financial management skills than I did.  So, I don't know why and on what they were trying to advise me about.\n\nThey had job trainings/counseling sessions.  They encouraged the residents to go out and apply for jobs in person.  I laughed at this.  I used to be a manager for a financial management company and retail.  We don't take resumes in person anymore.  It's the 21st century!  When I was working in retail.  Some people would insist of leaving their resumes with us.  Then, we would take it and shred it.  I thought the job training/counseling that they provided was very dated.\n\nThe only reason that I give this place a two star is because this was a place I stayed at while I was homeless.  However, I was not impressed by the services that they had to provide.",
            "Highly organized place for women that are homeless and jobless to get a new start. Very clean and lots of counselors for the residents to help them become a healthy individual. I was extremely impressed with the success they have in their program and the dedication of their staff.",
            "My review is with the shelter connected with the wise place building. They call it \"safe place\". I was there, to get shelter, but I wasn't prepared for the awful experiences I had there. Women with attitudes, filthy mouths, drug addicts, alcoholics, thieves, bullies trying to control and manipulate, cots with no personal space or privacy. Breathing fumes from the cleaners(guys)who mixed bleach and fabulosa and right at the bed time at night, when everything is closed up. Staff wasn't enforcing the rules. People were loud and out of control. All most of the women there did  there (for months) is lay around, eat, and watch t.v.. Almost every day or night there was an angry outburst of yelling. People who threaten you don't get kicked out. Not a peaceful, safe place."

Not only is the team there incredibly helpful and welcoming but they are truly passionate about the work they do at PATH. JB is amazing and we feel fortunate to have the opportunity to give where we live. Thank you PATH for letting us join in your mission!"

I have a full time job I\u2019m a full time student plus take care of my daughters, got no time to full around anymore.

            "I thank God for this place. If it wasn't here, not sure where I'd be. There are things wrong  but there is MANY right here. This place and many more are needed in the world today. The cost of rentals here in Santa Maria are sky-high now and almost impossible for one person to make it. The staff here will help you find a place to call home. If they can't they will send you in the right direction. They are also helping me with insurance. Basically, I think of this place to get your life in order so you don't find yourself homeless again. Everyone has their own room here so if the world gets to be too much you have a spot to  unwind and get right. The staff are great here. Some rules are crazy but I feel privileged to be a pioneer and help show staff which rules are great and which aren't. We are all different so it can make for an interesting day. The \"bossman\" Brian does take time to listen to us all. Heather takes care of the younger (over 18) ones and she's doing a excellent job! It's not perfect here but boy it's so much better than where I've been!",

I  mentioned to shelter staff, Yvonne, that I had an SD, and she said, \"That's a deal breaker.\" She said she'd talk with the director, and I should call in a couple of days. I called, and she denied us again after speaking with her coworker, Lisa. I reached out to Director Brian Halterman, who hung up on me 3 times, and also denied me because my SD is unaltered.\n\nIn the end, I am still homeless with my family of 6. They were of no help at all.\n\nUpdate: In October 2024, I filed a complaint with the Department of Justice. Brian Halterman has since been fired as the shelter director.",

They help with many things including nurse visits, housing options, a safe place to sleep, referrals for mental health. They provide 3 meals a day including second servings, they provide self-service laundry twice a week. Clothing if needed. Case management. All provided by friendly staff. I was really hesitant to come here but so very grateful. My life has been tremendously blessed by my choice to come here! 3 mos clean! #rainbowvillage",

I know how this place was before the Good Samaritan took over and in the beginning of the process. Everyone is right about what happened. However, I think and feel that the Good Samaritan has put a very good management team together. This place is taking a dramatic change for the better. Of course there are things needing more attention and some things should change. I've been here since July and have seen the meals for breakfast and dinner get a lot better. The manager is working on finding someone to help with lunches and a place that can help us get our laundry done. But since the past is the past and some people helped gave the bridge house a bad name. No one is willing to help! So if you read this I would like for you to think of change. \"I mean that's why Obama is a president now.\" Right? Please help spread the Good message that there is change here and ask yourself if your willing to change. Change the past to the now. Please help by finding churches with any help?"

            "My cousin went there for help with a domestic violence situation and one of the workers knew one of her abusers and gave them all of her information including court documents and exposed all of her evidence. The worker laughed about it in a recording that my cousins primary abuser showed my cousin and said that my cousin was lying. This place is failing my cousin and whoever runs this place should have handled it and reassured my cousin when she went to the cops about this situation. A scared person asking for help shouldn\u2019t have to go through this because of a place specifically for helping victims. Suzanna Reyes and Enelinda\nOcampo are responsible for the victim blaming. Whoever their authorities are, I would appreciate if they reached out to me.",

            "I've interacted with Empower Tehema at their office on 2 seperate occassions and once at the Sheriffs Department last week.\n\nI would like to think they are there to support the victim and their family, but so far that's not what I am seeing.\n\nI am very nervous about this agency.\n\nWhen my friend went to them for help in the past she was turned away and told there was nothing they could do for her.\n\nIt wasn't until CPS sent my friend back to them that they finally started my friends paperwork.\n\nI get the impression they are trying to frame my friend even though they know she came forward and was rejected/turned away.\n\nWhat I found surprising during the forensic interview was that the Empower staff had Starbucks deliver a large amount of drinks and pastries but failed to offer it to the victim or her family.\n\nA Sherriff did offer me one of the coffee's and I accepted but was never given it.\n\nI kept waiting for it and finally asked, but was provided a cup of coffee from the Sheriff's coffee machine.\n\nI wasn't mad, I can afford to buy my own coffee.\n\nIt was just a thoughtless action and very poor manners.\n\nI ponder where the funds came from that paid for the Starbucks food & beverages. Did those monies come from a victims fund?\n\nWhat was worse was the message that thoughtless action sent which was \"you may be the victims, but we are the team\".\n\nI hope they rethink such activities in the future and think of the victims before themselves.\n\nAll I can do at this point is hope for the best, wait and see.\n\nI will be back to update this review when all is said and done."

They would rather keep you there than to help with what you're needing/asking help with : leaving Chico. Also Justin is currently sick there right now from shelter food poisoning, possibly undercooked meat. This place should have funding removed or shut down. First shelter I know of that gets you into it and then redirects you to call the 211# as you are sitting right there with them. Avoid this place.",

I got an apartment so I will be leaving tomorrow so blessed that this place is here in our community to help out people who are in need. Big shout out to the staff!

            "I have been a homeless woman for about 2 1/2 years now and been in and out of various shelters and I can say BY FAR this is the WORST place I have ever stayed. From the constant moaning and complaining from every other resident there to the staff purposefully kicking residents out on false accusations and complete bull crap, I would never recommend this shelter to anyone. I was warned about this shelter when I first moved here to chico, but I'm someone who gives people the benefit of doubt. So I gave them a chance. The first time I was kicked out was because one of the ladies said that I put hands on someone else. ( I'm the least violent person this place has ever seen). Second time I was kicked out, was because I chose to take my dog to the vet instead of cleaning my bed space and THEY KNEW I had a vet appointment for him cause they were the ones who made that appointment! And third time I was kicked out was because I PLAYFULLY flicked my husband on the ear. Seriously, it was PLAYFUL. This place has had men forcefully push and punch staff members and are welcomed back within 3 days. However, when I PLAYFULLY flicked my husbands ear, suddenly I'm REDFLAGGED and forever banned from their shelter!?\nThey never helped me anyways. The only time I ever got help was when I moved into the Jesus center (current housing sit.) that I got the help I needed. DO NOT GO TO THE TORRES SHELTER! THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOU ON THE STREETS, HOMELESS, HUNGRY AND SCARED.\n\nDONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!",
            "A great place to go if you need to start your life or restart your life if you are homeless in Butte county for 30 days. It has housing and work search assistance. It can be a long term solution for needed work experience. A great educational start to get training at local colleges, or housing readiness classes including case management. Assistance available, if you choose it and show you're dedicated to improvement of your situation. Great staff and case managers but little tolerance for trouble makers or aggressive behavior",

I didn't even break them, and they threw me out. Plus they refused my reasonable request for accommodation under ADA, and kicked me out for having the issue I was requesting accomodation for. After they threw me out I asked, in writing, if they'd let me use their toilets, and they ignored me. I am nobody to them. When I protested that they were throwing me out over their mistake and not mine, the attendant laughed at me and ridiculed me and started provoking me and got me worked up then started filming me and suggesting I get violent. I left screaming, then screamed and cried uncontrollably outside their gate for hours, and they never even so much as offered me a cup of water.\n\nThree stars because the rec room was nice and the portapotties were clean.",
