Newsom, 57, posted a link on X to a website set up by his campaign committee . The site urges users to give money to the California Fire Foundation and links them to a module from ActBlue, the Democratic Party\u2019s fundraising platform . Critics quickly pointed out that ActBlue takes a portion of all donations as a processing fee . \u201cNot a cent of these donations go to Gov. Newsom is proud to have raised $450,000 for the Fire Foundation in small-dollar contributions during these fires and is grateful for the people across the nation who have come together to help Californians in their time of need",
