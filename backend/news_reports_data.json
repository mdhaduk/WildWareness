Pasadena Humane says it is working with other shelters across the state that offered to take in animals that had already been in the shelter's care before the blazes erupted . The first fires broke out Tuesday, killing at least five people, and causing massive destruction with homes leveled . Officials said more than thousands of structures have burned with tens of thousands more threatened . Officials say 179,000 people under evacuation orders have been put under the evacuation orders, and firefighting resources are stretched thin . Wildlife smoke can be dangerous for pets, especially puppies, senior dogs and birds, according to AirNow.gov.gov, a government-run site on air quality data",

Nonprofit rescue group Grey Bull Rescue met with Musk and first responders over the weekend to help set up the Starlink devices, which connect to satellites, in the Los Angeles area . Musk also donated numerous Starlinks in the western North Carolina region after Hurricane Helene in late September left thousands without power or internet for days, making it difficult for survivors to contact first responders and loved ones . On Sunday, Musk said that he would be donating Cybertrucks to impacted areas as well.\"Apologies to those expecting Cybertruck deliveries in California over the next few days\"",

Wildfires are a regular occurrence in California, and have been since well before the arrival of humans . Human development in more parts of the state has increased the risk of fires spreading into populated areas, such as LA . In California's recent history, wildfires have closed national parks, destroyed the state\u2019s natural and cultural treasures, killed vulnerable residents, destroyed homes, and caused countless environmental issues ranging from mudslides to wildlife deaths to habitat and species loss . The Dixie Fire, ignited in July 2021, was the first fire to burn across the entire Sierra Nevada mountain range, obliterating the historic Gold Rush-era",

The veteran NBA coach said while his family and friends are safe, the loss of property is \"unfathomable\" At least seven people have died in Southern California wildfires as thousands evacuated their homes . Around 10,000 structures from the Pacific Coast to Pasadena have burned down in the blazes as strong winds continue to fuel the fires . The largest fire burning in the area began on Tuesday and containment was at 6%.",

Financial analysts at Wells Fargo Securities released a report to clients on Sunday . At least 24 people have been killed in the outbreak of wildfires in the greater Los Angeles area, while officials say that at least 12,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed in the blazes . At a total insured loss of $40 billion it would represent a 2% hit to equity for insurers, the analysts wrote . Last week, JPMorgan analysts released a preliminary estimate that insured losses would reach $20 billion, which would make it the costliest in California's history, surpassing the 2018 Camp Fire which caused about $10 billion in insured losses . The Camp Fire impacted the Northern California town of Paradise",

At least five people have been killed in the fires and over 2,000 homes, businesses and other structures have been damaged or destroyed . JPMorgan's report noted that most of the damage and insured losses in the Camp Fire came from personal property losses, which accounted for 86% of the losses compared to 12% for commercial property and 2% from all other lines and auto insurance . The 2018 Camp Fire devastated the town of Paradise and several nearby communities and caused 85 fatalities, according to the report . Firefighters have struggled to contain the wildfires, which are being driven by strong Santa Ana winds .",

Newsom, 57, posted a link on X to a website set up by his campaign committee . The site urges users to give money to the California Fire Foundation and links them to a module from ActBlue, the Democratic Party\u2019s fundraising platform . Critics quickly pointed out that ActBlue takes a portion of all donations as a processing fee . \u201cNot a cent of these donations go to Gov. Newsom is proud to have raised $450,000 for the Fire Foundation in small-dollar contributions during these fires and is grateful for the people across the nation who have come together to help Californians in their time of need",

Gavin Newsom for dismantling the state\u2019s emergency response volunteer firefighting units . A senior enlisted leader told The Daily Signal that the California Professional Firefighters union complained to CAL FIRE that it didn\u2019t want \u201cnonprofessional firefighters\u201d on its fires . Rep. Issa said dismantling volunteer fire departments is not only an additional cost, but it eliminates a force multiplier . Issa said there is \u201cno question at all, you cannot afford to have rank-and-file fire departments in these rural areas at any cost, so as a result, there were less people responding\u201d More than 300 wildfires in Los Angeles and other areas of Southern California have killed",

They are part of a long-running volunteer programme led by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . The state pays inmates a daily wage between $5.80 and $10.24 (\u00a34.75 and \u00a38.38) The programme, which dates back to 1946, has divided critics, who see it as exploitative, and supporters, who say it is rehabilitative . The incarcerated firefighters have been working \"around the clock cutting fire lines and removing fuel from behind structures to slow fire spread\", CDCR said . At least 11 people have been killed in the wildfires, with 35,000 acres from the two largest fires already burned .",

        "text_summary": " Climate Whiplash is a classic example of an extreme weather event that is linked to climate change by organizations and individuals that have a vested interest in advancing the threat of climate change . The idea behind the climate whiplash connection to the Los Angeles fires is that very wet winters in Southern California in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 enabled a great deal of vegetation growth but that the very dry beginning of the 2024-2025 winter allowed that vegetation to dry out, resulting in a landscape primed for uncontrollable wildfires . \u201cEvery fraction of a degree of warming speeds the growing destructive power of the transitions\u201d says lead author Dr. Daniel Swain of the UCLA Press Release for the paper: \u201cLos Angeles is burning.\u201d",

        "text_summary": " Southern California wildfires have burned nearly 40,000 acres, claimed 25 lives and displaced countless residents . The fires produce \"super toxic\" smoke laden with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and toxic chemicals from burned buildings, posing severe respiratory and cardiovascular risks to millions, even those far from the fires . Residents are advised to stay indoors, use air purifiers and wear N95 masks . Estimated property and infrastructure losses range between $250 billion and $275 billion, potentially making this the costliest disaster in U.S. history, surpassing Hurricane Katrina . The crisis highlights the need for improved wildfire response and public awareness of smoke risks as fire seasons grow longer and more intense, experts say . The smoke from these wildfires is not just a nuisance \u2013",

There were a couple more map layers for pollution and an aggregated view, but it\u2019s good to see the app still running . Props to Cal Fire for running and maintaining a usable data feed for almost a decade . The data goes back to 2016 . I hope everyone is keeping safe, but the map is still showing up to date in the Los Angeles area, which is still active .",

Carbon dioxide from wildfires is not counted against California\u2019s emissions targets . Carbon emissions from California's 2020 fire season alone make up 49 percent of the state\u2019\ufffds 2030 emissions target . California's expansive wildfires were the second largest source of emissions in the state in 2020, behind only the transportation sector . The carbon emissions released from the 2020 wildfires equate to $7 billion in total global damages, or about $986.9 million in damages to the U.S. and some $98.7 million to California . While some of the carbon release from fires will be balanced by later vegetation regrowth, it will not occur quickly enough to avert highly dangerous levels of increased emissions, temperatures, and climate change",

They can move tons of sediment during a single storm, as Montecito, just up the coast from Los Angeles, saw in 2018 . The geography of the land, burn severity, storm intensity, and soil characteristics all play important roles in if, when, and where debris flows occur . A whopping 21.8 million Americans live within three miles of where a fire burned during the past two decades, and that population more than doubled from 2000 to 2019 . Climate change is also increasing the amount of moisture the atmosphere can hold downpours, leading to more intense rain . Even without rain, debris-damaged fire-damages can be unstable",

Water agencies are responsible for providing critical retail water service to properties across the state, including water to aid fire suppression . Water systems were not designed to meet the significant demand from wildfires, especially the climate-driven fires that California experiences today . Water supply has not hindered firefighting efforts. Reservoirs in California are at or above average storage levels for this time of year, thanks in part to years of proactive water management .

Many species have evolved to rely on the opportunities created by others . The Los Angeles wildfires that occurred in January 2025 are predicted to have cost in excess of $135bn\u00a0(\u00a3109.7bn) How do different species eke out a living among the devastation? And in a world with increasingly large fires, exacerbated by global climate change, is there any way humans can help them? We would lose biodiversity if we did not have fire in our system, says\u00a0Morgan Tingley, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), .",

The company anticipates that the losses from this extreme wind-driven wildfire event will exceed its reinsurance retention level of $150 million . Mercury General's reinsurance program provides $1,290 million of coverage per occurrence, with provisions for reinstatement of limits for future events . Investors should monitor the situation closely, as the final loss figures could influence Mercury's financial performance and stock valuation . As climate-related risks continue to rise, insurance companies may need to reassess their risk management strategies and pricing models to ensure long-term sustainability . Mercury's experience could serve as a case study for the industry in adapting to these challenges, says GurFocus.",

Lightning is the most common cause of wildfires in the U.S. No lightning activity was reported in the affected regions, including the terrain surrounding the Eaton Fire in East Los Angeles County . The California wildfires underscore the region\u2019s vulnerability to devastating blazes, exacerbated by a combination of dry conditions, urban expansion, and diverse ignition sources . So far, there is no official indication of arson in either the Pacific Palisades or Eaton fires, but investigators are meticulously analyzing the origin points to determine whether human negligence or other factors played a role . As of Friday, both fires were still burning with minimal containment .",

Vice President Kamala Harris, a former U.S. senator for California, also spoke at the White House briefing . The death toll from the Los Angeles wildfires stands at five, but officials say that number will likely increase once the fires have been brought under control and workers can comb through the ruins . A leading national credit rating service says preliminary estimates show the fires could result in more than $8 billion in property losses .

The Golden State's struggles with damaging wildfires in both Southern California and Northern California in recent years have prompted scrutiny of regulations that critics say make it more difficult to conduct mitigation activities like prescribed burns or treatments to remove hazardous trees and vegetation . Over 70,000 residents of the area are under evacuation orders as strong Santa Ana winds gusting up to 100 miles per hour continue to push the fires . At least five people have died in the wildfires, including the Palisades Fire, which has destroyed an estimated 1,000 structures in the greater Los Angeles area as of Wednesday, and the Eaton Fire near Altadena .",

Some posts suggest that these incarcerated firefighters work for around $10 per day . Others allege these firefighters will not be able to get jobs as professional career firefighters upon release . California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) manages 35 fire camps across 25 counties in California . As of January 2025, there are currently 1,870 incarcerated persons working at fire camps throughout the state of California, and 1,600 of them are firefighting crew members . Incarcerated firefighters used to make up as much as 30% of the California wildfire force, but the numbers have dwindled over the years, largely due to state prison reform and the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report .",

People who lost their homes or spent time fighting fires alongside neighbors and first responders are likely grappling with trauma . Consider getting a PTSD diagnosis and getting a medication for PTSD . Practice self-care whenever you can, like taking hot to cold showers, lighting candles, or bingeing a good television show . For many it could be a harsh reality\u2014 stepping back from work altogether could be overworking as a distraction .
