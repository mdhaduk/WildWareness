## **Proposed Project:**
WildWareness is a web application designed to provide real-time wildfire information, emergency shelter locations, and community-reported fire updates in the state of California.

The platform serves:
- People in wildfire-affected areas who need information on active fires and emergency shelters.
- Volunteers and first responders looking for ways to help communities impacted by wildfires.

Users can:
- Track active wildfires with real-time data.
- Find emergency shelters near affected areas.
- View and (eventually) submit community reports on wildfire conditions.

## **Data Sources** *(RESTful APIs and Web Scraping)*
- [CAL FIRE](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025) â€“ Reports active and past wildfires with containment details (2025)
- [NewsData.io API](https://newsdata.io/)- Community/local reports and headlinges fetched from NewsData.io
- [Google Places API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/places-backend.googleapis.com?project=hardy-position-450923-v1)- Google's API used for fetching information about a location on Google Maps.
- [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com?q=search&referrer=search&project=hardy-position-450923-v1) - a service that allows you to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude & longitude) and vice versa (reverse geocoding).
- [List of Emergency Shelters Website](https://www.californiawildfirelawyer.com/fire-damage-list-of-shelters/) - a website containing a list of emergency shelters by county and city in the form of text.
